placed sources in the government , the company has informed the  madhav godbole panel that it would be meeting on may 11 . earlier reports had  indicated that the discussions with the panel would take place on may 5 .  according to sources , enron would be meeting the panel with representatives  of its lenders and shareholders . the godbole committee , that studied the  current power purchase agreement , has called for cancellation of the present  tariff structure , renegotiation of the lng and shipping contract , removal of  dollar denomination as far as fixed charges of the tariff is concerned , debt  restructuring and the formation of a committee to renegotiate the power  purchase agreement . these suggestions , it seems , may not be acceptable to  enron . the maharashtra government accepted the report and asked the godbole  committee to renegotiate . the committee has been given a month  , s time to  renegotiate on behalf of the state government with dpc for a new ppa .  the committee has opined that since the lng facility of 5 mmpta is far in  excess of what is required by the plant ( only 2 . 1 mmpta of which 1 . 8 mmpta is  on take or pay ) , it should be separated into a distinct facility whose  capital costs should not be reflected in the fuel charge , not as take or pay .  it should instead be only in proportion to the fuel regassified for the power  generation . using the entire allocated gas requires an unusually high plf .  instead , the surplus gas can be sold to other players like petronet or enron  ,  s own metgas .  & it is important to distribute the cost over the entire  capacity and not just the amount sold to the power plant ,  8 says the  committee . similarly , it has been suggested that enron could lease out the  harbour facilities as a common facility to other lng importers . on the lng  contract negotiated by enron for long - term supplies , it has said that since  the lng market has witnessed great changes , particularly as far as prices are  concerned , the power company should take advantage of spot buys and  renegotiate the contract accordingly .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  the times of india , friday , may 04 , 2001  enron ready to take part in ppa talk , nitin yeshwantrao  the enron management has finally agreed to participate in a ' discussion '  with the madhav godbole - led re - negotiation committee set - up to facilitate  the restructuring of the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) signed between the  us power major and the state government . officials of dabhol power company  ( dpc ) , a subsidiary of enron , alongwith their team of shareholders and  lenders will arrive here on may 11 for talks with the nine - member godbole  panel . though the dpc spokesperson was reluctant to give a confirmation , a key  mantralaya official told the times of india that the team had expressed  willingness for talks with the experts committee in a bid to end the  imbroglio .  enron ' s response is viewed as a welcome development to amicably resolve the  controversy which had been raging for the last few weeks , with the board of  directors of enron authorising its india md k wade cline to serve a  termination notice to mseb . the state government , on its part , too adopted a  confrontational position by slapping a rs 401 crore rebate charge on dpc for  defaulting on power supply . however , the sudden change of heart by the enron  management is largely attributed to the stand taken by its local lenders led  by industrial development bank of india ( idbi ) which had recently opposed the  move to pull out of the project . this was in contradiction to the stand taken  by the foreign lenders of the dpc who were in favour of slamming the brakes  on disbursement of funds to dpc . the congress - led democratic front government  had publicly declared that it would impress upon the enron management to  renegotiate the ppa as scrapping the project would not be in the interest of  both the parties .  last week , the state government constituted a nine - member panel of experts  under former bureaucrat madhav godbole . godbole had written to the dpc  management inviting it for talks to re - negotiate the ppa on may 5 . for the  delayed response from enron , the meeting has been rescheduled to may 11 . the  issues which would be debated at the meeting include the separation of the  lng facility from the power plant , renegotiating lng supply and shipping  agreements , redefining the dpc tariff and to convert it into a two - part  tariff . the godbole panel will bargain hard for removal of dollar  denomination in the fixed charge component and to allow the maharashtra  government to sell power to third parties .  - - - - -

arrival of its team from houston and other parts of the world .  however , the company has ultimately decided to meet the godbole committee on  may 11 .  dpc spokesman jimmy mogal said :  & we confirm that dpc has been invited to meet  the recently formed negotiating committee . as a matter of courtesy , we have  agreed to meet them next week . since the purpose of our meeting is to hear  out the committee and understand their thoughts , we will not present any  proposals .  8  & while we have constantly maintained that we are open to a  dialogue towards resolving issues , this meeting in no manner be construed as  an open offer from dpc to renegotiate the terms of the contract . furthermore ,  the published terms report do not represent an acceptable basis for further  discussions ,  8 he added . sources said enron corp chairman kenneth lay is likely  to meet former chief minister sharad pawar to find an acceptable solution  for the ongoing crisis before the may 11 meet . mr lay told the foreign news  agency on wednesday that the enron corp has no immediate plans to sell its  stake in the troubled $ 2 . 9 -

4095,"Subject: dhabol  jeff ,  we shall forward to you shortly a copy of the message from sandeep with the  numbers you have  requested . what follows below are the extracts from two recent articles on  the power situation in india  published by the financial times .  the first article describes recent power outage in northern india affecting  millions of people .  one possible line of defense is pointing out to the value of output lost due  to power  shortages . it is obvious that the value of lost production exceeds the cost  of power produced  by the dhabol plant ( expensive as it may be ) . the power cut affected 230  million people .  the second article is enron specific .  vince  asia - pacific : power failure hits north india  financial times ; jan 3 , 2001  by angus donald  tens of millions of people were left without electricity  in northern india  yesterday after a power grid breakdown .  electricity was gradually switched on in some areas and  most parts of the  capital new delhi , with 60 to 70 per cent of supply  expected to be restored  by the end of the day , according to power grid  officials .  the associated chambers of commerce and industry  ( assocham ) , a  leading business organisation , expressed "" deep concern ""  and called for a  mechanism to prevent future disruption that could  "" cripple the economy "" .  the power failure across eight indian states , including  new delhi , disrupted  train services , water supplies and the telephone network  and forced  hospitals to switch to emergency generators .  the fault occurred on the northern grid , which provides  electricity for 226 m  people , and affected the states of delhi , haryana ,  punjab , uttar pradesh ,  himachal pradesh , madhya pradesh , rajasthan and jammu  and kashmir .  a breakdown at a sub - station in kanpur in uttar pradesh ,  india ' s most  populous state , caused an overload of power on other  lines , which then  failed as well .  trains stopped running for most of the day and signals  systems were  damaged . new delhi international airport was also  slightly affected before  its own power supply could be engaged .  "" we will probe into the reasons for the failure . it is  most likely to be a  technical failure , but we will investigate why it  happened , "" suresh prabhu ,  the power minister , was quoted as saying by press trust  of india .  india suffers regularly from power problems because of  lack of funding to  upgrade infrastructure . theft of supplies is also a big  problem . thirty per  cent of the country ' s electricity is stolen , according  to analysts . in new  delhi as much as 50 per cent is stolen .  two years ago , a power failure blacked out uttar pradesh  and delhi for  hours .  assocham issued a statement , saying that increasing  industrial demand  would exacerbate the problems already faced by india ' s  inefficient power  sector . "" the slow progress , particularly in  strengthening the transmission  and distribution system , and ever increasing theft will  contribute to  worsening the power supply situation further . ""  copyright : the financial times limited  , copyright the financial times limited 2000 . "" ft "" and "" financial times ""  are trademarks of the financial times . privacy policy | terms jan 3 , 2001  by khozem merchant  enron , the us energy producer and a constant target of  criticism in india , is  hitting back with a campaign to reverse its image as a  profiteering  multinational .  its "" myth and reality "" offensive in local newspapers  follows the west indian  state of maharashtra ' s decision to review the tariff it  pays the texas - based  company , whose dollars 2 . 2 bn electricity generating  plant at dabhol is  india ' s biggest single foreign investment .  maharashtra ' s tariff has more than doubled since 1993  and is three times  greater than that charged by other independent power  producers ( ipps ) .  the tariff has risen because of the depreciation of the  rupee against the  dollar and the high but now falling price of naphtha  fuel . the state also pays  a fixed capacity charge of rs 970 m ( dollars 21 m ) a month ,  reflecting the  huge project cost and , controversially , irrespective of  consumption .  a showdown looks inevitable , reminiscent of a clash six  years ago that  damaged india ' s appeal to foreign investors . a former  official of the world  bank , which has criticised the deal , says enron is  emerging "" as the east  india company of the 21 st century "" - a reference to the  british trader that  colonised key areas of the indian economy in the 19 th  century .  the stand - off is the latest blot on india ' s power  sector . the uk ' s powergen  and cogentrix of the us have quit india recently ,  frustrated by long approval  procedures , inadequate payments mechanisms or because of  higher  returns elsewhere .  "" india has lost time and opportunity and has driven  returns down by six  percentage points , "" says gerry grove - white , former india  general manager  of powergen , which has sold its 655 mw plant in gujarat  to china light &  power of hong kong .  india ' s national plan for the five years to 2002 says  generating capacity  must rise by 40 , 000 mw to about 120 , 000 mw . but since  1992 , ipps have  added only 3 , 000 mw and 2 , 500 mw remains under  construction . this is  insufficient to support official projections of 6 to 8  per cent economic  growth .  enron was a bellwether of india ' s liberalisation ,  winning fast - track project  approval in the early 1990 s . phase 1 , a 740 mw plant  fuelled by expensive  naphtha came on stream in may 1999 , and phase 2 , a  dollars 1 . 87 bn plant  of 1 , 624 mw capacity that will run on cheaper liquefied  natural gas ( lng ) ,  will be completed this year . only two of seven other  fast - track proposals  have achieved financial closure .  from the outset enron encountered attacks , culminating  in maharashtra ' s  then nationalist government cancelling the project  before renegotiating  terms no less onerous . vilasrao deshmukh , chief minister  of the successor  government , says the power purchase agreement is  unaffordable .  enron , whose attackers also include cultural  chauvinists , wants to maintain  good political relations in a hostile but lucrative  environment . enron views  india as a testing ground for its evolution from a  traditional manager of  power plants to a broad - based trader of commodities ,  such as energy , gas  and bandwidth .  to support these ambitions enron hopes to trade energy  between power  surplus and deficit states , once legislation is passed  this year . it is building  an lng terminal and pipelines to trade imported natural  gas . and it is  laying a 15 , 000 km fibre - optic network to trade bandwidth  space in a country  desperately short of this new economy commodity .  in any event , enron believes it has a watertight  contract . it is supported by  many that believe any subversion of the contract would  confirm investor  perception of maharashtra , india ' s financial and  industrial hub , as an  unreliable destination for investment .  mr deshmukh - who has avoided the language of his  predecessor , which  threatened to "" dump dabhol into the arabian sea "" - is  under pressure from  radical members of his wobbly coalition . but his options  are limited .  scrapping the project would be ruinous for an  economically troubled state  that would have to compensate shareholders .  maharashtra state electricity board , the local utility  and enron ' s main  client , is obliged to dispatch or "" off - take "" 90 per cent  of dabhol ' s output . yet  mseb has never honoured these guarantees . its off - take  has averaged 60  per cent since the plant opened and , in effect , mseb has  been paying a lot  more while consuming a lot less power .  one reason off - take is low is because the state ' s tough  new regulator has  told mseb to buy from cheaper sources . enron says the  tariff would be  rs 4 . 02 / kwh if mseb ' s off - take averaged 90 per cent . but  with off - take a  third lower , the average tariff is rs 4 . 94 per unit , and  often higher . in  october , the tariff was rs 6 . 91 per unit , when off - take  was about 49 per  cent . enron says tariffs should come down when phase 2 ,  run on cheaper  lng , starts .  these cost pressures have forced mseb to take up only  half of a 30 per  cent equity option in phase 2 . enron has acquired the  balance and  mandated bankers to find a buyer .  enron ' s difficulties have undermined the appeal of ipps ,  which have failed to  deliver the flood of investments . potential ipps feared  they would never be  paid by state generating boards that have become a  byword for corrupt  management of power .  reform of state electricity boards , whose uneconomic  pricing means  industrial users subsidise poor farmers , as well as  transmission and  distribution ( t & d ) services to check huge theft and  technical losses , is  overdue .

4164,"Subject: access on the block : international transmission auctions - cera a  lert - december 20 , 2000  title : access on the block : international transmission auctions are opening  european power markets  e - mail category : cera insight  cera knowledge area : european power  despite an apparent impasse in negotiations among european transmission  system operators , regulators , and the european commission in florence ,  auctions of international transmission capacity ( itc ) in france , the united  kingdom , denmark , belgium , italy , austria , switzerland , slovenia , and the  netherlands are opening access between countries and paving the way for the  single european marketplace .  however , the patchwork auctioning of access to itc leaves important issues  unresolved . the most significant of these include the potential for gaming ,  third - party transit , and the allocation of auction proceeds . as they stand ,  these issues , cera believes , are likely to lead to action at the european  level and the eventual imposition of a more integrated scheme .  nevertheless , current plans to open most of europe ' s itc represent a  watershed of activity that will hasten transparency in the market and  determine trade flows and signal transmission investment in 2001 .  international auctions are opening markets  a major portion of international transmission capacity on the continent will  be allocated by auction in 2001 ( see table 1 ) . in cera ' s view auctions for  itc are likely to have the greatest impact during 2001 in the following areas :  * increasing market transparency . the posting of available transmission  capacity on yearly , monthly , and daily bases will facilitate the market ' s  efficient usage of scarce interconnector capacity . for the first time ,  signals for new transmission investment , power flows , and transmission asset  valuation will come from the market .  * increasing cross - border trade . although auctions may not reduce uncertainty  in the marketplace initially , the effect of heightened transparency in access  rules and prices will soon work to increase trade . secondary markets for  interconnector capacity will add to the number of actively traded power  products and work to increase the overall level of trade . ?  * increasing price correlation . auctions will replace nonmarket - based  allocation methods such as long - term capacity reservation . the dynamic  character of shorter - term auctions , combined with an expected secondary  market for capacity , should bring access to international capacity in line  with the needs of the market . in this way the market will be able to adjust  more rapidly to changes in local conditions and thereby work to correlate  pricing points .  * increasing competition . once players have secured access to itc at a given  price , they will be looking to sign supply contracts or integrate the  capacity into structured deals . the result could be more aggressive  maneuvering on the part of incumbents and new entrants alike , resulting in  greater competition at the national level .  * reducing the competitiveness of imports . the results of international  transmission capacity auctions will determine the competitiveness of imported  power into domestic markets . final prices offered for itc will reflect the  relative cost of power between markets and work to make cheaper power more  expensive to import .  * spurring investment in transmission . the money raised through auction could  provide transmission companies with the financial capability to invest in  upgrading international transmission links . access to international  transmission capacity between the netherlands , germany , and belgium in 2001  was auctioned for 63 million euros ( see http : / / www . tso - auction . org for  details ) . ? auctions for access into spain , france , and italy are expected to  realize a premium for access to highly coveted markets .  connecting rather than integrating markets  auctions between national grids , or more accurately commercial grids , are a  pragmatic approach to the problem of granting access to scarce international  transmission capacity on an open and transparent basis . the auctions will  open access to interconnectors and at the same time reward transmission  system operators .  even so , the proposed approaches are not likely to satisfy market players or  the stated objectives of european policymakers . in cera ' s view the following  issues may eventually bring down the hammer on itc auctions :  * third - party transit . the bilateral nature of itc auctions perpetrates the  problem of tariff pancaking and discriminates against trade involving transit  through a third grid . this is ultimately inconsistent with the european  commission ' s objective of a single european power market . the fact that  physical power flows do not follow contractual flows and almost always  transit third - party grids further weakens the legitimacy of the approach .  * transaction - based scheme . although still transactional in nature ( tied to a  specific deal ) , auctions fall within the european commission ' s stated  preference for market - based mechanisms for allocating international  transmission capacity . it remains to be seen how successful this approach is  in achieving integration of national markets . action at the european level  could move allocation of itc in the direction of nontransactional mechanisms  such as market splitting , counter trading , or redispatching .  * gaming of auctions . auctions will in theory allocate access to transmission  on a nondiscriminatory market basis to those that value it most . in practice  it remains to be seen if gaming can be avoided . even though most of the  auctions have placed limits on ownership of transmission capacity , tactical  maneuvers could bid up transmission prices as players act to raise the price  of imported power .  * allocating auction proceeds . one likely outcome of auctions will be the  transfer of profits between players as transmission owners recoup some of the  rents currently reaped by other players . this will works to raise the value  of transmission assets relative to generation , suppliers , or traders . it  remains to be seen how funds from auctions will be allocated among  transmission companies and the grid , as transmission is still currently  subject to monopoly regulation .  * * end * *  come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 , "" shooting the rapids :  strategies and risks for the energy future "" in houston , february 12 - 16 ,  2001 ! ?

( enrononline )  represents an alternative solution under which enron acts as a principal in  every transaction . on the retail ? side , many retail e - commerce companies  offering auctions , reverse auctions and platforms for creation of buyers  ,  clubs challenge incumbent utilities . the objective of this project is to  evaluate the impact of e - commerce ( both at the wholesale and retail levels )  on the energy industry . the study will start with comparative analysis of  different wholesale trading and retail e - commerce business models and  evaluation of their long - term viability . the next step will be assessment of  the impact of e - commerce on price dynamics , profit margins and the level of  competition in different energy markets . a separate section will be devoted  to analysis of reaction of companies and organizations affected by e - commerce  ( incumbent utilities , organized exchanges , energy brokers ) to the new  competitive threat , and different strategies they implement to meet the  challenge . organized exchanges have accelerated in many cases the transition  to screen - based trading that has been already replacing open outcry  technology . power and natural gas marketers have created alliances ( with  other industry players , software companies and electronic exchanges ) to  create their own trading platforms . gas and electric utilities embarked on  development of vertical and horizontal e - commerce platforms , offering  services to households and other companies in the energy industry . the  critical question is how quickly different companies should react to the  competitive threats and how fast they should exploit opportunities created by  the internet based economy . it ' s quite obvious that the internet revolution  will change the energy industry ' s landscape during the next few years . the  objective of the project is to provide answers to the questions posed above ,  based on the currently available information . additionally , the participants  should come up with fallback strategies the energy companies should implement  in case the currently ? expected trends fail to materialize .   _"

2953,"Subject: pricing credit on thousands of names  all -  our challenge for the next few months is to build an automated system to  provide differential pricing on thousands of credits [ 5 , 000 by year - end ] .  most of these credits will be illiquid in terms of market price information ,  making the challenge harder , and the end result more important in terms of  competitive pricing advantage . what we need is an overall strategy for how we  plan to achieve this from the quantitative perspective .  currently we have several models for credit pricing either in use or under  development :  fmc model ( default probability approach ) . using bloomberg ' s fair market ( par  yield ) curves , probabilities are generated from the risky - libor , then  default / bankruptcy swap prices computed using expectation methodology .  fmc model ( credit spread approach ) . using the fmcs , then directly taking the  libor credit spread at each tenor , adjusting for basis and compounding  differences .  bond model ( fmc approach ) . taking the fmcs as benchmark curves , the model  regresses the input bonds ( specific to a name ) on the two best fitting  benchmarks . the result is a zero yield curve with the same shape as the fmcs ,  but with the level tweaked for the specific issuer . prices are then generated  using both spread and probability approaches . under testing .  bond model ( spline approach ) . taking only the bonds specific to an issuer ,  the model fits an exponential cubic spline to the zero - coupon price curve ,  then builds a zero yield curve from this . under testing .  market prices . for certain liquid names , or sectors / ratings , cds market  prices are used , then recovery and event discount used to get bankruptcy swap  prices .  kmv . using expected default frequencies ( edfs ) from the kmv model and  database , we will build a model to price default swaps , making appropriate  risk adjustments . kmv is being installed now , so model will be worked on next .  each of these models returns a price ( credit default and bankruptcy ) , and the  accuracy of the price depends on many factors - liquidity and regulatory  differences between bond and cds markets , recovery assumptions , risk premia ,  capital charges , etc . the aim will be to accurately price as many liquid  names as possible , based upon these models , then use these prices , alongside  other financial information , as the backbone to a full automated pricing  system .  our inputs to the proposed pricing system for a specific name are model and  market prices for all issuers , alongside name - specific ' soft ' data from  credit reports and financial statements . if the credit is liquid enough , a  price will be generated from their own information only . otherwise , the  credit will be mapped onto a subset of liquid credits , with financial  information and historical price movements providing the mapping and weights .  the model price will then be periodically adjusted to align itself with  market ( or trader ) prices , and this adjustment will feed back into the  weighting and mapping composition . in loose terms , we could think of the  system price for an illiquid credit as being a weighted average of liquid  market prices ( bonds , equities , default swaps ) , where the weightings are  calibrated using credit analysis , financial ratios , etc .  the key steps to implementing such a system will be :  establishing what exactly we want to ' predict ' - is it a price , a rating , a  probability , or a score ? we will need a clean market history to calibrate to ,  which we only really have for ratings . we will then need to develop a mapping  from rating / score to price .  getting and cleaning the historical financial and credit data required to  calibrate the model .  building the mechanics of the model , ie , the calibration methodology . neural  nets / fuzzy logic seem the obvious candidates , but which exact methods and  software packages to use ?  determining an automated methodology for mapping names with limited  information into the model .  getting the "" true "" market price , in order to feed back an error . at present  such a price exists for very few credits .  allocating resources to the development . mckinsey claimed such a system would  take 6 - 10 man - months to develop .  further ideas or comments are requested , as we need to develop our strategy  asap . the model description above is fairly vague , as we don ' t yet have the  knowledge needed to fill in the specific details . further help will be  especially required on this if we are to continue to move at ' internet speed ' .  regards  ben"

6505,"Subject: re :  joe ,  i have written to pal quilkey to invite christian werner to houston  for a week to discuss how much of his research we can use .  vince  joseph hrgovcic  08 / 01 / 2000 06 : 51 pm  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , mike a roberts / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject :  vince ,  i have inquired into christian ' s climate models . it seems to me like a long  term project . chiristian says that his model might be able to do better than  the australian met given that they ignore some of the variables he uses and  that they are an "" old boy ' s network "" resistant to new developments , but i  don ' t think the same can be said of most other weather services . as far as  the nws goes , they run their model on a cray , they have several very talented  phd ' s working on it full - time , and even then , they can only get a dozen or  so runs per night . in other words , it ' s a huge system . replicating something  even close to that will not be an easy task .  that being said , i think there are related applications that we could look  into . since i ' ve already promised the rac group and the weather desk ' s pjm  traders to put together a vector autoregressive model of daily temperatures ,  i think it makes sense to see if something better than a var model can be put  together , perhaps a very stripped down version of the kind of model christian  has . what i have in mind is something that would give us say , up to several  dozens of "" possible "" temperature forecasts every morning , which would be  calculated using actual climate models ( as opposed to time series models ) . i  would not use this as a forecasting tool ( the nws model results would make a  far better "" best guess "" ) , but our ensemble could still be used to provide a  distribution of temperature scenarios . this ensemble would have several uses :  1 ) we could price the book for the ensemble of runs and thereby obtain a  more realistic daily v @ r for the weather book ( and eventually interface that  with the power desk ' s v @ r calculations )  2 ) we could use the ensemble of forecasts to relate temperature forecasts to  week - ahead cdd and hdd distributions ( for use in our demand swaps )  3 ) if freese - notis were to give us one of their qualitative forecasts ,  e . g . , "" expect the trough to recede "" we could sort through the different monte  carlo scenarions , find one in which the trough in question is receding , and  use corresponding output statistics to download the actual temperatures  corresponding to that scenario . up till now , we haven ' t found a good way of  getting a numerical fix on what different forecasts actually mean  temperature - wise  4 ) we could use the associated visualization routines that come with such  models to get animations of the evolution of historical weather patterns . the  traders could use these in order to look for historical periods which roughly  match current weather conditions and get an idea of what could happen ;  although these meteorological models would not be good for simulating  month - ahead or season - ahead weather ( trust me on this ) we could still use the  visualization technology to do to analogous seasonal animations .  just today , i ' ve spoken with dr . jacobsen of stanford university , who has  written one of the more recent textbooks on climate forecasting , and who  worked with ucla ' s general circulation model . he says that getting a  simplified version of mm 5 ( which is itself a simplified , limited - area version  of the gcm models that nws , cola , and ucla use ) would take several months to  implement , assuming the people involved are already well versed in the  technology . also , i have contacted aer , a massachusetts - based weather  consulting firm , and they tell me that they have a mm 5 model running daily  ( only one run per night ) , and also some smaller pc models up and running .  they are of course willing to work with us for a fee . their mm 5 version runs  on a $ 200 , 000 parallel processor .  i am open to your suggestions ( or objections as the case may be ) . i ' m not  sure how the costs would be apportioned given that this would benefit all of  enron , and not just the weather desk .  i am scheduled to go to boston next week anyway , and would like to use the  opportunity to visit with aer . i will of course coordinate any projects with  christian ( if we get something like this up and running it will be more  likely that he can get the computing power he needs to run his own australian  model ) .  joe"

5936,"Subject: california power 1 / 19 / 00  executive summary :  sb - 7 x gives dept . of water and resources given legislative authority to  undertake short - term power purchases with no price cap through feb . 2 nd  new legislation ( ab - 1 x and sb - 6 x ) would seek ( 1 ) long - term contracts with 5 . 5  cent cap and ( 2 ) creation of california power and conservation financing  authority  the long - term contracts proposed in ab - 1 x are likely to be subject to  significant amendment and renegotiation prior to the feb . 2 nd expiration of  sb - 7 x .  the authority proposed in sb - 6 x would have bond issuance powers to finance  new generation capacity and conservation measures  negotiations under way on using bond authority for a utility  bailout - - utilities and state government split over debt obligations of  utility parents  state borrowing plans and power purchases create credit risks for state  treasury ; socal edison misses more payments  bush administration opposes price caps , but is supporting state efforts to  split pg we believe he then could be willing to guarantee or  issue  bonds to deal with the rest .  as one very senior california political leader explained , getting the utility  holding companies to eat a substantial part of the debt they owe themselves  is the key to solving the back debt problem without provoking widespread  public outrage about a "" bailout "" of private price - gouging companies with  taxpayer money . since 75 % of californians currently blame the utilities and  the puc for this crisis ( and only 10 % blame davis ) , this is a crucial  political stance for the governor .  but , of course , absorbing anything like $ 6 billion in debt would be quite a  shock to the seemingly healthy holding company and power - generating branches  of the two utilities , and they began spreading the word that they were quite  willing to accept bankruptcy . thus by mid - week , both  sides had pushed themselves toward a resolution in federal bankruptcy court  that would be a worst case solution for all sides : the country ' s economy  would  suffer from the resulting credit shock , the governor ' s political future would  suffer from the electricity rate increases almost certain to be mandated by a  bankruptcy judge , while most private sector legal authorities believe the  utilities corporate holding structure would ultimately be breached during  bankruptcy  procedures and they would end up having to absorb some significant amount of  the debt in the end . in addition , they would most likely face a state  government  determined to use state powers of condemnation to enter the power business in  a major way .  senator burton ' s sb 6 x legislation will strengthen those powers dramatically  to make this point quite explicit . it would set up a "" california power and  conservation  financing authority , "" with the power to issue bonds and invoke eminent  domain . it would finance new power plants , and "" consider the feasibility and  public  interest of the state acquiring , operating , and maintaining transmission  facilities currently owned by investor - owned and municipal utilities . ""  as we write this , all sides are trying to construct a path back down from the  bankruptcy ledge to safe ground , and there is no question the tone has  shifted  in the last 24 hours from macho confrontation to "" maybe we ' ve run this thing  out as far as we can . "" but as we have noted , the chance for miscalculation is  still quite high . there is no solution agreed to at this time , the stand - off  over how much debt the state government will absorb versus the utilities '  holding  company is continuing , and the technical fact of default still makes it  possible for some bank to trigger bankruptcy by demanding immediate  accelerated payment .  5 . default update - thursday  socal edison - $ 215 million default to california power exchange .  after edison failed to make a $ 215 m electricity payment yesterday , the  california power authority began seizing long - term contacts and reselling  them to recoup some of the money owed to generators . pg & e said it expects  its trading privileges at the cal . power authority to be suspended today ,  leaving them with only its generation from nuclear and hydroelectric sources .  while the ongoing wave of defaults has severely restricted pg & e ' s and socal ' s  ability to buy power , the department of water and resources will be able to  pick up some of the slack , at least in the very short - term .  the state itself may be getting into risky credit territory . the proposed  california public power authority would borrow in the neighborhood of $ 1 . 3  billion from the state general fund in advance of this year ' s expected fiscal  surplus , with the loan to be repaid by the authority from expected future  revenues . with near - bankrupt utilities and a freeze on rate hikes , it is  unclear where the revenues would come from . the amount borrowed and terms of  repayment will be no doubt examined very carefully by the bond rating  agencies .  5 . bush policies  as we reported on wednesday , the bush administration continues to demonstrate  little interest in getting involved in the california crisis .  president - elect bush surprised state leaders yesterday with his comments ,  which essentially said that excessive environmental regulation was the root  of the current supply shortage . bush and his top officials appear to be  unanimously opposed to long - term price caps .  however , there is one issue of considerable importance to the administration ,  according to a source close to a top bush economic advisor . there is  significant concern that pg & e ' s credit problems could cause gas suppliers to  stop shipments of gas through pg & e ' s pipeline . the risk would be that the  pipeline could "" go dry "" , causing significant and possibly dangerous  disruptions in california residences and businesses . to prevent this  problem , bush is working with davis on a proposal to split pg & e into separate  gas and electric companies . the gas company would be solvent , but the  electric company would go immediately into ch . 11 following significant  defaults ."

"" that ' s why i ' m sitting up  here and you are all sitting out there ! ""  with network marketing you have two sources of income . direct  commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from  sales made by people you introduce to the business .  residual income is the secret of the wealthy . it means investing  time and money once , and getting paid again and again and again .  in network marketing , it also means getting paid for the work of  others .  the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my  fingers . fortunately , sometime later i reread everything and gave  some thought and study to it .  my name is jonathan rourke . two years ago , the corporation i  worked at for the past twelve years down - sized and my position  was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to  open my own business . over the past year , i incurred many  unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and  creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my  business and i just couldn ' t seem to make ends meet . i had to  refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and  struggling business . at that moment something significant happened  in my life and i am writing to share that experience in hopes that  this will change your life forever financially ! ! !  in mid december , i received this program via e - mail . six month ' s  prior to receiving this program , i had been sending away for  information on various business opportunities . all of the programs  i received , in my opinion were not cost effective . they were  either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial  investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work  or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one  year . it didn ' t tell me i ' d have to write a book to make it !  but like i was saying , in december i received this program . i  didn ' t send for it , or ask for it ; they just got my name off a  mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! !  after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it  correctly , i couldn ' t believe my eyes .  here was a money making phenomenon .  i could invest as much as i wanted to start without putting me  further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it  out , i would at least get my money back . but like most of you i  was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal  aspects of it all . so i checked it out with the u . s . post office  ( 1 - 800 - 725 - 2161 24 hrs ) and they confirmed that it is indeed  legal ! after determining the program was legal and not a chain  letter , i decided "" why not . ""  initially i sent out 10 , 000 e - mails . it cost me about $ 15 for my  time on - line . the great thing about e - mail is that i don ' t need  any money for printing to send out the program , and because all of  my orders are filled via e - mail , the only expense is my time . i am  telling you like it is . i hope it doesn ' t turn you off , but i  promised myself that i would not ' rip - off "" anyone , no matter how  much money it cost me .  here is the basic version of what you need to do :  your first goal is to receive at least 20 orders for report # 1  within 2 weeks of your first program going out . if you don ' t , send  out more programs until you do .  your second goal is to receive at least 150 + orders for report # 2  within 4 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do .  once you have your 150 orders , relax , you ' ve met your goal . you  will make $ 50 , 000 + but keep at it ! if you don ' t get 150 right off ,  keep at it ! it may take some time for your down line to build .  keep at it , stay focused , and do not let yourself get distracted .  in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report  # 1 . i kept at it - kept mailing out the program and by january 13 ,  1 had received 26 orders for report # 1 . my first step in making  $ 50 , 000 in 90 days was done .  by january 30 , 1 had received 196 orders for report # 2 ; 46 more  than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 1 , of my  e - mailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every  day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car .  please take time to read the attached program , it will change your  life forever ! ! remember , it won ' t work if you don ' t try it . this  program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the  rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it  won ' t work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money !  in order for this program to work very fast , try to meet your goal  of 20 + orders for report # 1 , and 150 + orders for report # 2 and you  will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 90 days . if you don ' t reach the first  two goals with in four weeks , relax , you will still make a ton of  money , it may take a few months or so longer . but keep mailing out  the programs and stay focused ! that ' s the key . i am living proof  that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program ,  i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or  risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and  you will be on your way to financial security .  if you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble  like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this  a sign . i did ! - sincerely , jonathan rourke  p . s . do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look  like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome !  a personal note from the originator of this program :  by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you  should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal ,  could not have been created by an amateur .  let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business  for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was  doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but  it wasn ' t working .  finally , i figured it out . it wasn ' t me ; it was the economy .  inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had  been with us since 1945 .  i don ' t have to tell you what happened to the unemployment  rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there  were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before .  the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were  doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not including  those who never had anything to save or invest were moving down  into the ranks of the poor .  as the saying goes , ' the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . ""  the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to  "" move up "" or "" get rich "" . inflation will see to that .  you have just received information that can give you financial  freedom for the rest of your life , with "" no risk "" and "" just a  little bit of effort .

 to assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the 5  reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing  information which includes how to send bulk e - mails , where to find  thousands of free classified ads and much , much more .  here are two primary methods of building your downline :  method # 1 : sending bulk e - mail  let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes ,  and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 , 000  programs each . let ' s also assume that the mailing receives a 0 . 5 %  response . using a good list , the response could be much better .  also , many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs  instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out  only 2 , 000 programs . with a 0 . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders  for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000  programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those 0 . 5 % , 100 people  respond and order report # 2 .  those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the  0 . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000  send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the 0 . 5 %  response to that is i 0 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that amounts to  10 , 000 each of $ 5 bills for you in cash money ! then think about  level five ! that ' s $ 500 , 000 alone !  your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5 , 000 + $ 50 , 000  + $ 500 , 000 for a total of $ 555 , 550 ! ! !  remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of the 2 , 000 people  you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program !  dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone , or half  sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of 2 , 000 . believe me , many  people will do just that and more !  report # 2 will show you the best methods for bulk e - mailing , and  e - mail software .  method # 2 - placing free ads on the internet  1 . advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive , and there are  hundreds of free places to advertise . let ' s say you decide to  start small just to see how well it works . assume your goal is to  get only 10 people to participate on your first level . placing a  lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response .  also assume that everyone else in your organization gets only 10  downline members . follow this example to achieve the staggering  results below : lst level - your 10 members with $ 5 . . . . . . . $ 50  2 nd level - 10 members from those 10 ( $ 5 x 100 ) . . . . . . . $ 500  3 rd level - 10 members from those 100 ( $ 5 x 1 , 000 ) . . . . . . . $ 5 , 000  4 th level - 10 members from those 1 , 000 ( $ 5 x 10 k ) . . . . . . . $ 50 , 000  5 th level - 10 members from those 10 , 000 ( $ 5 x 100 k ) . . . . . . . $ 500 , 000  this totals - $ 555 , 550  remember friends , this assumes that the people who participate  only recruit 10 people each . think for a moment what would happen  if they got 20 people to participate ! most people get 100 ' s of  participants .  think about it ! for every $ 5 . 00 you receive , all you must do is  e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it ! always provide  same - day service on all orders ! this will guarantee that the  e - mail they send out with your name and address on it will be  prompt because they can ' t advertise until they receive the report !  available reports * * * order each report by number , and  name * * *  * always send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not  accepted * - always send your order via first class mail - make  sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets  of paper ( so that the bill can ' t be seen against light ) on one of  those sheets of paper include :  ( a ) the number & name of the report you are ordering ,  ( b ) your e - mail address , and  ( c ) your name & postal address ( in case your e - mail provider  encounters problems ) .  place your order for these reports now :  report # 1 "" the insiders guide to advertizing for free on the  internet ""  order report # 1 from :  randy dillard  p . o . box 8  osprey , fl 34229  usa  report # 2 "" the insiders guide to sending bulk email on the  internet ""  order report # 2 from :  carla brown  p . o . box 39093  sarasota , fl 34238  usa  report # 3 "" the secrets to multilevel marketing on the internet ""  order report # 3 from :  glynn schmidt  p . o . box 19424  sarasota , fl 34276  usa  report # 4 ' how to become a millionaire utilizing the power of  multilevel marketing and the internet ""  order report # 4 from :  christin joy  cpo 2398  501 e . college avenue  wheaton , il 60187  usa  report # 5 "" how to send one million e - mails for free .

4666,"Subject: latest draft  don ,  attached is my latest effort . it entailed fairly drastic "" restructuring  and reorganization "" of the earlier draft . my revision effort has been  directed at improving the focus of the paper . the new story is the following :  1 . enron was formed as a regulated gas pipeline company in the mid - eighties .  2 . economic and competitive conditions conspired to force a dramatic  reorganization of the company almost immediately . the result was the  creation of a new , unregulated energy trading operation . the strategy of  the new unit was to capitalize on business opportunities in the  deregulation of markets that was occuring at the time ( mid - eighties until  now ) .  3 . the business model adopted for the new unregulated business was that of  a "" gas bank "" . the analogy to a commercial bank posed a very difficult  problem to enron ' s management in that there was no source of liquidity to  the market from a central bank authority . as a consequence enron had to  develop its own very elaborate risk management procedures .  4 . another consequence of the new business model was that it required a  different set of employee skills and talents . specifically , it required  were bright , energetic and innovative individuals capable of identifying  entrepreneurial opportunities and starting new businesses . furthermore , a  new , flatter organizational structure entailing decentralized decision  making was required to facilitate quick response to changing market  conditions . to monitor and manage this new "" empowered "" labor force  required that the firm develop new personnel policies and procedures .  5 . three primary tools of personnel management were adopted : ( i ) measure  performance semi - annually , ( ii ) tie compensation closely to performance ,  and ( iii ) allow personnel free movement within enron to seek out the best  opportunities .  6 . other attributes of the enron model include consideration for asset  optionality , recognition of the value of networks in adding value to  trading platforms , and the use of mark - to - market accounting for business  transactions as a means of ensuring transparency and promoting prompt actions .  if my "" story line "" sounds better than the draft i have attached its because  its the last thing i ' ve written . at any rate i look forward to hearing  your comments and to getting this wrapped up .  thanks and i look forward to seeing you in february .  john  - enron _ paper _ 1 _ 26 _ 01 . doc  john d . martin  carr p . collins chair in finance  finance department  baylor university  po box 98004  waco , tx 76798  254 - 710 - 4473 ( office )  254 - 710 - 1092 ( fax )  j _ martin @ baylor . edu  web : http : / / hsb . baylor . edu / html / martinj / home . html"

"" breakthrough "" products in the vspc pipeline  vpsc products in the process of commercialization are expected to enable up to 10 hours of laptop computer usage , and three weeks of cell phone operation using fuel cells , gps - free navigation , especially for places where gps doesn ' t work ( a top dod priority ) , automated analysis of air and seaport cargo containers based on x - ray imaging ( homeland security ) , identification of narcotics , chemicals , and biological weapons .  another total breakthrough , with a nanotechnology based mass spectrometer is a portable , carry - on suitcase size device that processes identifies one molecule at a time : further miniaturization is expected to shoebox size , compared with stationary desk size provided by today ' s competitors .  significant recurring income from fuel cell batteries  in five years , annual revenue from disposable fuel cartridges for fuel cell - powered portable electronic devices is expected to range between $ 7 billion on the low side to $ 45 billion on the high side . that market does not exist today .  vspc ' s fuel cell cartridge business model is similar to the well - known razor / razor blade model , which is to sell the razor and then make much more money on the recurring blade business . the fuel cell is a razor , and the disposable fuel cartridge is the razor blade .  another analogy is the  flashlight / battery model . imagine if a company had the primary intellectual property involved in manufacturing flashlights . it would probably license that technology to major flashlight manufacturers , in return for help in dominating the recurring flashlight battery business .  in this case vspc has the proprietary rights to the ' flashlight ' - - the fuel cell - - and intends to sell the "" flashlight battery "" - - specifically , disposable fuel cartridges , for an end - user price of $ 2 - $ 3 each .  vspc is currently negotiating to provide its patented fuel cell technology to major computer manufacturers , in return for their agreement to use disposable fuel cartridges developed by vspc , the manufacturing of which will be outsourced to well - known , major plants in the far east .  intellectual property protected with patents  vspc ' s fuel cell technology , for example , is protected by over 70 issued and pending patents .  strategic partners lend credibility  to create a cost - effective worldwide footprint , emerging companies must partner with branded , global companies who have strong management teams and significant resources .  vspc is partnering with major , well - known market leaders who have management , resources and global branding . partners are attracted to vspc ' s technology , and expect to gain competitive advantage by integrating patented , proprietary technology obtained from vspc .  for example , in the fuel cell business , toshiba , nec , sanyo , hitachi and samsung have unveiled prototype fuel cell powered products that more than double the operating time over existing battery technology . these companies are potential strategic partners for vspc . to better work with japanese manufacturers , vspc has opened a tokyo office .  "" fabless "" business model enables cost - effective growth  fabless semiconductor chip companies design and develop proprietary chips , then outsource manufacturing to wafer plants in the far east . some well - known fabless semiconductor companies , ranked by market capitalization , include  $ 12 billion market cap , broadcom ( brcm )  press here to view  $ 11 billion market cap , marvell semiconductor ( mrvl )  press here to view  $ 9 billion market cap , xilinx ( xlnx )  press here to view  $ 7 . 3 billion market cap , altera ( altr )  press here to view  $ 4 . 5 billion market cap , nvidia corp ( nvda )  press here to view  $ 4 . 4 billion market cap , sandisk corp ( sndk )  press here to view  $ 3 billion market cap , ati technologies ( atyt )  press here to view  ( other technologies products to be discussed in future analyst report updates )  vspc expects to use emerging computational , rf , imaging and nanosensor technologies to drive market growth by enabling gps -

$ 4 . 20 per barrel higher than a year ago and $ 3 . 46 per barrel greater  that the previous five - year average . for the first quarter of 2001 , cera  anticipates distillate margins to moderate somewhat but remain at a record  high level of $ 4 . 75 per barrel in the first quarter .  * jet / kerosene differentials versus wti rose $ 0 . 63 per barrel from the  october average , reaching a whopping $ 8 . 59 per barrel in november . in  correspondence with the distillate market , jet / kerosene margins are at  historically high levels and receiving support from relatively tight  fundamentals . cera expects jet / kerosene margins to moderate somewhat in the  first quarter in response to seasonal weakening of demand following the  holiday travel season but to remain exceptionally strong at an average of  $ 5 . 75 per barrel .  * margins for us gulf coast 1 % sulfur residual fuel dropped by $ 2 . 15 per  barrel , reaching $ 3 . 99 per barrel below wti during november . despite the  recent widening of differentials , cera expects soaring natural gas prices to  support relatively narrow residual fuel differentials throughout the winter  months . residual fuel differentials are expected to average $ 2 . 50 per barrel  below wti during the first quarter of next year , at the high end of the  historical range .  us demand highlights  * apparent demand for unleaded gasoline fell seasonally by about 0 . 5 million  barrels per day ( mbd ) from the october level , reaching 8 . 36 mbd for the four  weeks ending december 8 . demand is averaging less than 1 percent below last  year largely because y 2 k concerns helped inflate december demand a year ago .  cera anticipates gasoline demand to continue to decline seasonally as colder  temperatures arrive , averaging 8 . 08 mbd during the first quarter of 2001 .  * reported distillate apparent demand remains exceptionally strong at 3 . 94  mbd for the four weeks ending december 8 , over 7 percent greater than this  time last year . this represents a slight increase of about 0 . 05 million  barrels ( mb ) from the end - october level of 3 . 90 mb , but still a record high  level for early december . with support from low home heating oil inventories ,  particularly in the northeast , distillate demand has been very strong during  the fall of 2000 . cera expects demand to remain strong in the coming winter  months , averaging 3 . 79 mb during the first quarter of next year .  * apparent demand for jet fuel declined by 5 percent from the october level  to reach 1 . 68 mbd for the four weeks ending december 8 . despite the decline ,  apparent jet fuel demand is over 1 percent above the year - ago level . the  relative strength of jet fuel reported demand continues to parallel  distillate demand strength with support coming from the use of jet fuel to  help mitigate the tight distillate market fundamentals . cera expects the  demand for jet fuel to average 1 . 81 mb during the fourth quarter .  * reported demand for residual fuel dropped to 0 . 87 mbd for the four weeks  ending december 8 , a decline of about 0 . 09 mbd from the october average and a  slight increase over the november level . demand for residual fuel is  currently 11 percent greater than last year , and surging natural gas prices  are expected to result in continued strong residual fuel demand throughout  the winter . residual fuel demand is expected to remain in the 0 . 85 to 0 . 9 mbd  range during the first quarter of 2001 .  us inventory highlights  * primary inventories of unleaded gasoline rose to 196 . 5 mb , increasing  almost 10 mb from the end - october value . responding to rising stock levels  and declining apparent demand , forward supply coverage of gasoline climbed to  23 . 5 days for the four weeks ending december 8 . forward supply is 2 . 5 percent  below last year ' s level at this time of year and at its lowest level in the  past eight years - although cera still believes coverage is currently  sufficient for the level of demand expected this winter . however , cera is  looking cautiously at the implications of high distillate refinery yields and  production because of the possibility of low gasoline inventories at the  start of the driving season in the second quarter of next year .  * distillate inventory coverage has remained about level since the end of  october at 29 . 2 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending december 8 .  despite record high apparent demand , strong refinery production levels helped  boost primary distillate inventories slightly , to 115 . 3 mb for this period .  primary stocks are 16 percent below last year ' s level at this time and at  their lowest historical level ever . although stocks are low , cera does not  anticipate shortages to occur this winter . assuming normally cold weather ,  refinery production and net imports are expected to be capable of meeting  demand requirements - albeit at a high price .  * jet fuel inventory coverage crept upward by about 1 day of coverage , to  reach 25 . 7 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending december 8 . this  moves jet fuel coverage above the 23 . 5 to 25 days ' supply range that it had  been in for the past four months . the rise of just under 1 day in forward  supply was mainly a response to a decline in apparent demand . jet inventories  and coverage are expected to become tighter in the coming weeks as the pull  from tight distillate markets strengthen , but supplies are expected to be  adequate for the winter .  * inventory coverage of residual fuel rose by almost 4 days of forward supply  from october , reaching 41 . 7 days of forward supply during the four weeks  ending december 8 . the increase in coverage was a temporary response to a  drop in demand and an increase in stocks . with demand expected to strengthen  because of colder weather and high gas prices , cera looks for inventories and  coverage gradually to decline in the coming weeks .  * * end * *  this cera alert will be available in pdf format within 24 hours .  this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information  from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

3579,"Subject: alliance info alert : ferc report on western markets  at its special meeting today , ferc released the results of its eagerly  awaited probe into california ' s summer power crisis , concluding that under  certain circumstances , california ratepayers were subjected to unjust and  unreasonable power rates due to california ' s "" seriously flawed "" market  structure and rules in conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions  throughout the west .  the ferc staff report on western markets and the causes of the summer 2000  price abormalities , entitled , part i of staff report on u . s . bulk power  markets , is available at the following website :  in response , ferc issued an order proposing a series of sweeping structural  changes to the california iso and px to help remedy the pricing problems , and  solicited public comment by november 22 . a technical conference has also  been scheduled for november 9 , to discuss the proposed solutions and other  remedies that might be suggested ( details tba ) . while all four commissioners  supported the order , the order stretched the commission . chairman hoecker  and comm . breathitt expressed strong endorsements , while comms . hebert and  massey concurred , citing areas where they felt the commission had either  "" over - reached "" or not gone far enough , as discussed below . a final order is  expected to be issued by year ' s end .  at the same time , the commission warned california consumers of their  continued risk of paying higher prices unless policy makers there resolve  state issues , such as : ( 1 ) immediately implementing the availability of day  ahead markets for power purchases ; ( 2 ) development of demand responses ; ( 3 )  siting of generation and transmission ; and ( 4 ) assurance of sufficient  reserve requirements .  highlights of proposed california structural remedy  in its order , ferc proposed a series of market overhauls , including :  ( 1 ) eliminating the state ' s mandatory requirement that the state ' s  investor - owned utilities buy and sell electricity through the px , and allowing  these utilities to purchase electricity through forward contracts and other  alternative mechanisms to manage supply risks .  ( 2 ) requiring market participants to schedule 95 percent of their  transactions in the day - ahead market and instituting a penalty charge for  under - scheduling ( in excess of five percent of hourly load requirements ) , in  order to discourage over - reliance on the real - time spot market .  ( 3 ) establishing independent , non - stakeholder governing boards for the iso  and px .  ( 4 ) modifying the current single price auction system by ( a ) imposing a  temporary $ 150 / mwh "" soft cap "" that prohibits supply bids in excess of $ 150  from setting the market - clearing price for all bidders ; ( b ) requiring sellers  bidding above $ 150 / mwh to report their bids to ferc on a confidential , weekly  basis and provide certain cost support ; and ( c ) requiring the iso and px to  report monthly information on such bids . the commission ' s price mitigation  measures would remain in effect through december 31 , 2002 .  ( 5 ) declining to order retroactive refunds for the state ' s ratepayers and  utilities , citing insufficient authority to do so , but subjecting sellers to  potential refund liability for transactions from october 2 , 2000 until  december 21 , 2002 , but no lower than their marginal or opportunity costs , if  ferc finds non - competitive behavior .  ( 6 ) encouraging accelerated state siting approval and introduction of demand  response management programs .  separately , the draft order rejected the iso ' s request for an extension of  its current purchase price cap authority , and the px ' s request for price  capping authority .  commissioner responses  comm . herbert reluctantly concurred , noting that his decision may change when  a final order is considered based on comments filed or testimony offered at  the november 9 meeting . he stressed that he would have preferred that the  order address four areas : ( 1 ) eliminate all price controls in california  markets ; ( 2 ) abolish the single price auction entirely ; ( 3 ) terminate the  "" buy and sell "" mandate in the px ; and ( 4 ) direct the iso to address a long  list of cited problems in its january 2001 rto filing , rather than having the  commission prescribe specific remedies .  hebert stated that while he was opposed in principle to the "" soft cap ""  concept , if one had to be adopted , then the soft cap should increase  incrementally increase over time at specific pre - announced dates . he  believes that this would serve to both encourage greater investment in  facilities and additional forward contracting as well as provide an incentive  for california regulators to address market design and other flaws . also , he  would not have disbanded the stakeholder governing boards at this time , but  allow the iso and px to address this issue in their january 2001 rto  filings . in addition , he would not dictate risk management methods ,  preferring instead that market participants determine appropriate actions on  their own . finally , he advised californians not to be so environmentally  focused that they do not realize their tremendous need for generation  capacity .  comm . breathitt stated her approval of the order while warning that ferc  cannot allow the events of this past summer to reverse or slow the progress  towards open and competitive markets . she noted that it was the commission ' s  job to guide the market to self - correct and not to conduct "" command and  control . "" she also commended the managers of the iso and px , saying that  they have performed admirably . however , she noted she is awaiting comments  on the single price auction remedy and its accompanying confidential  reporting requirements .  comm . massey concurred , but emphasized that he advocates a more aggressive  approach . he feels that the congress has "" put its thumb on the scale "" in the  federal power act to protect consumers . stating that prices will continue to  be unreasonable in the future , he believes that this order moves in the right  direction , by proposing solutions to identified problems such as an over  reliance on the spot market , lack of demand response , the need to  reconstitute governance of the iso and px and the elimination of the buy / sell  mandate . comm . massey specifically called for comments regarding whether the  $ 150 / mwh soft cap went far enough , whether ferc has the legal authority to  issue refunds and to determine whether there should be a requirement for a  certain percentage of forward contracting to hedge against the spot market  price volatility .  finally , chairman hoecker stated his strong support of the order , but noted  that this is "" no time to pull punches . "" he emphasized that the commission  needed frank comments from the industry . he echoed comm . breathitt ' s warning  that competition is at risk and that they needed to get the markets back on  track . noting that the commission lacked authority to order refunds , he  stated that the responsibility rests with congress . addressing  jurisdictional issues , he stated that siting problems encountered at the  state level are slowing the "" meandering transition "" to competition . he feels  that the state of california and ferc need to work together to resolve these  problems and that ferc is not attempting to usurp power . rather , california  is part of a broader interstate market and is dependent on the western region  for reliable energy , thus placing the burden on federal action to make things  work , hoecker maintained . the chairman also said that the commission will  fully investigate and act upon complaints of market power abuse or further  evidence provided by staff ' s ongoing investigation .  if you have any questions or comments , please call jack cashin at  202 / 508 - 5499 ."

3073,"Subject: auctions with an incumbent ' s right of first refusal  shelley ,  my colleague , clayton vernon , who has a background in economics , wrote a  short summary of arguments  against the rofr .  we are working on the second approach to the problem : we try to come up with  a numerical estimate of the  value of this option . the fact that an incumbent shipper has this option has  distributional consequences :  he has something of value he never paid for . having a numerical estimate of  the value of this option  could help to argue against it . the value of such an option is case specific ;  so we shall rather  produce a template you can use for valuation case by case .  vince kaminski  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by vince j kaminski / hou / ect on 01 / 20 / 2000  08 : 34 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  clayton vernon @ enron  01 / 20 / 2000 08 : 29 am  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc : stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect , zlu / hou / ect @ ect  subject : auctions with an incumbent ' s right of first refusal  vince -  here is an essay on the issue you are discussing :  the adverse economic impact of "" rights of first refusal ""  an option to "" first refuse "" to match a competitor ' s offer is a restraint of  free trade and an impediment to efficiency in the marketplace . this economic  conclusion is unambiguous .  if an "" incumbent "" has the right to match an offer made by a competitor , for  an item or service of value , then few competitors will invest the time and  expense necessary to prepare and submit offers , those offers will be lower  than they would have been otherwise , and the contract will often be awarded  to an inefficient incumbent instead of a more efficient challenger .  in a traditional auction , where all bids are sealed and the item up for  auction is awarded to the highest bidder , we can safely predict the item will  be awarded to the bidder who values it the most , at a price reflecting the  full value of the item up for auction . this is the efficient result in a  market economy , because the financing of the high bid reflects resources  freely allocated to the high bidder . if the auction has open bids , we can  again safely predict the item to be awarded to the correct bidder , albeit at  a slightly lower price to the donor of the item since the bidder with the  highest valuation can simply increment by an infinitesimal amount the  second - highest valuation .  now , in a modified auction , where an incumbent bidder has the right to match  the highest bid and retain the item for himself , each competing bidder must  justify his own due diligence and bid preparation expenses against the  following , and likely , scenario : the incumbent does not spend himself for due  diligence , but instead uses these savings to help finance his matching the  top bid from a competitor .  simply put , the incumbent with a "" right of first refusal "" can be safely  predicted to simply match their competitor ' s bid by "" rule of thumb . "" but the  incumbent ' s valuation of the item up for auction can be less than the  valuation of the competitor , by the amount of the due diligence and  administrative expenses . and , the incumbent firm expropriates the expertise  of his competitors , not only in their valuations themselves , a nontrivial  financial exercise , but in any operational details required to be submitted  along with the bid .  furthermore , in an esoteric concept known as the "" winner ' s curse , "" a bidder  realizes that if his bid actually prevails , if the incumbent fails to match  it , he almost certainly overbid .  given this , most competitors will not even bother to bid in an auction when  an incumbent has the right of first refusal , and those that submit a bid do  not rationally invest the time , expense and expertise necessary ; they may  just "" fire off "" a "" low - ball "" bid . after all , in almost every conceivable  "" state of the world "" arising from the auction the competitors expect to lose  money . so , the incumbent almost always retains the contract at a  below - market price , despite the incumbent not necessarily placing the highest  value on the contract because the incumbent cannot put the contract to its  most efficient use ."
3391,"Subject: re : efa meetings  hey vince ,  thanks for your reply . i ' ll see what becomes of the session and keep you  informed . as to the paper , tim crack and i have a revised version of the  paper i gave you . we have since found out that by using certainty  equivalence , our model is more robust . for example , if one has an asset  pricing model that incorporates mean , variance , and skewness ( harvey and  siddique , jf june , 2000 ) and a binomial model that incorporates mean ,  variance , and skewness ( johnson , paulukiewicz , and mehta , rqfa , 1997 ) , our  model allows you to price options under the real world measure . the  benefit is that one can take all of the model parameters from historical  data that is non - risk neutralized .  from a pricing perspective , there isn ' t a tremendous benefit in a  mean - variance world ( variance stays the same in risk neutral or risky  measure ) . however , in the mean - variance - skewness world , there is a benefit  because we do not believe ( although we ' re still hunting down an appropriate  cite ) skewness is the same under risk - neutral and risky measure . given we  can only measure the skewness in our risky world , our model becomes much  more significant .  i would certainly appreciate comments on the version of the paper you  have and would also pass on the new version of the paper if you would like  to see it .  thanks again ,  tom"

1917,"Subject: commercialization of nasa technology  hey , i thought you might like to take a look at viaspace  the cohen report  viaspace was founded in 1998 as a spin - off of the caltech / nasa jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) to transform technologies originally developed for space and defense markets into profitable commercial enterprises . viaspace seeks opportunities in high growth markets delivering on problems with growing global relevance by leveraging unique expertise not available elsewhere in the commercial world . viaspace sees a compelling business opportunity in the homeland security public safety and fuel cell markets . viaspace target markets are in excess of $ 100 b / yr and growing with a cagr of over 20 % . in the past six years viaspace has created three companies , spectrasensors , qwip technologies and vialogy corp . their websites provide a background on the commercialization of nasa technology , ( spectrasensors . com , qwip . com , vialogy . com ) . the company ' s current focus is on three subsidiaries , direct methanol fuel cell , arroyo sciences and ionfinity .  direct liquid methanol fuel cell  direct methanol fuel cell corporation ( dmfcc ) will provide disposable methanol fuel cell cartridges for tomorrow ' s fuel cell - powered portable electronic devices such as laptop computers and cell phones . methanol fuel cells ( dfmc ) are expected to replace lithium ion batteries in portable electronic devices . a dfmc can power a laptop for up to 10 hours on a disposable cartridge that costs $ 2 to $ 3 . a smaller cartridge can power a cell phone for up to 3 weeks . we believe consumers will spend a few extra dollars for the convenience of keeping their cell phones and other electronic devices operating . as a disposable product , it generates recurring revenue for dmfcc .  the technology is protected by over 70 issued and pending patents . toshiba , nec , sanyo , and samsung have unveiled prototype fuel cell powered products that more than double the operating time over existing battery technology . dmfcc has opened a tokyo office to work closely with japanese manufacturers .  arroyo sciences , inc .  arroyo focuses on the fusion of radio frequency , nuclear and electromagnetic imaging to deliver information products in transportation , supply chain , security , logistics assurance and first responder safety markets . the micro tracker product enables a wireless tracking for first responders in hazardous environments . this product combines radio frequency identification ( rfid ) tags , wireless digital communications , ground positioning satellite ( gps ) , data for 2 - d and 3 - d geolocation determination , geographic information system ( gis ) and sensor technologies . real - time processing of many high data content inputs is required for the instantaneous assessment of danger . applications include improved safety for fire department personnel in emergency situations , improved coordination of multi - agency deployments and extended operations in hazardous environments .  the cobra product uses the imaging and sensing technology to provide early threat indicators for coastal surveillance and public infrastructure protection such as ports , power plants , airports , and telecommunication facilities . real time sensory and image data is processed and software is customized to discriminate between friend and foe .  deepscan is a software system that provides automatic analysis of air and seaport cargo containers based on x - ray and gamma ray imaging . arroyo is currently using deepscan for bomb and hazardous material detection in cargo .  ionfinity  ionfinity has developed the next generation mass spectrometry ( ms ) technology that is 10 times more sensitive than existing ms , with a 10 times increase in mass range . higher sensitivity enables the comprehensive monitoring and detection of biological , chemical and nuclear contaminants . the current market for ms is estimated at $ 1 . 2 billion annually . the compact size and rugged portability will expand the market . new applications include enabling port inspection personnel to detect traces of contraband , epa air quality monitoring and assisting in hazardous material clean up .  additional projects under review  projects not included in our forecast are ( 1 ) a water purification technology and ( 2 ) interactive radio . the water purification system displays impressive statistics in that it can convert brackish , sewage or industrial wastewater into ultra - pure water . the water system is scalable from house to municipal usage and will last 25 years while requiring minimal maintenance . the interactive radio enables a listener to receive emails or web sites delivered in response to what is broadcast . the radio station essentially receives input from listeners that could enhance advertising and improve vertical market focus .  forecasts and valuation  we expect revenues for dmfcc will be driven by ( 1 ) increasing wireless usage of computing devices and ( 2 ) the existing need to extend cell phone battery life . we expect revenues for dmfcc will commence in 2007 and grow to $ 195 million by 2009 . homeland security expenditures on airport and seaport security will be a primary revenue driver for arroyo sciences , which will begin to generate revenues in 2005 , and will grow to $ 90 million in 2009 . we expect commercial revenues for ionfinity will commence in late 2007 , and will be $ 10 million in 2009 . beyond 2009 , total revenues will grow at a 60 % to 80 % rate for several years from existing and new products . contracting with existing manufacturers , we expect operating margins will be in the low 40 % range by 2009 . our initial forecasts indicate a fair value range from $ 8 . 40 to $ 11 . 10 based on the projected growth for the 2009 to 2012 timeframe . the graph below outlines our valuation analysis .  directors and management  dr . carl kukkonen , is the ceo and founding partner . dr kukkonen was director for space microelectronics and manager of supercomputing at caltech / jpl , where he worked for 14 years . prior to jpl , dr . kukkonen was the leading expert on hydrogen as alternative fuel at ford motor company .  aj abdallat , coo , and vp of business development has been with viaspace since inception , after working in business development at hewlett - packard and control data corporation .  dr . sandeep gulati has been with viaspace since 2000 . during the prior 12 years , dr gulati was head of the ultracomputing technologies at nasas jpl . dr . gulati is the developer of the revolutionary signal processing technology , qri .  viaspace overview  viaspace was formed in july 1998 with an objective of transforming technologies from caltech / nasa ' s jet propulsion laboratory and other advanced technology centers into profitable commercial enterprises through its strong connections with the advanced technology community . through its three subsidiaries -

3124,"Subject: ees operational risk  per our conversation , here is the model that i have for simon . the notes  that i gave you were from some work i did back in september as i was looking  for volume numbers . the notes show what drives the final cash flow numbers .  briefly , the issue surrounds exactly what is meant by nonmarket and  noncredit risk . ideally , this would be anything that effects npv of the  deal . however , i think that we should limit ourselves to those things that  effect the time and amount of the eam volumes . even here , such a problem set  is quite large . if you glance at the spreadsheet model , you will notice that  there exists a large number of possible items that effect the eam volumes .  if we are to do this rigorously , then it is necessary to tear apart ees ' s  business model , and although such an attempt to do so would be noble , the  scope of such an excercise may be too large . we need a clear definition of  ees operational risk .  briefly , from the ees deals that i have looked at , two things drive their  profit : a long term bet that power prices will go down , and that we can  improve the facility through various enhancements . each of these may be  gleaned from the spreadsheet , as well as the assumptions regarding the  funding of the facility improvements and so on . 95 % of the savings is  assumed to come from power , and 5 % from gas . ( the effeciency gain may not be  explicitly given ) . if we have data that show the realized efficiency gains ,  then it would be simple [ in principle ] to determine a distribution , and hence  a distribution of eam volumes , npv ' s , etc . at this time , i understand that  rac has determined some of the realized efficiency gains , but my knowledge is  quite sketchy . jay hachen may have more info .  if i get a chance , i will try to see if i can do a "" proof of concept ""  excercise , but i have a late january deadline on something else .  another point : even if we are successful in doing this for the spreadsheet  model , ees has chosen to book things differently . i do not have a thorough  understanding of their it systems , but at least in principle , if we can do  this for the spreadsheet model , then we can do it in their it environment  ( data are data are data ) . they may book efficiency gains through improvement  type , such as gains due to compressors , chillers , boilers , etc . if this is  indeed the case , then we need to have distributions for each type of  improvement .  if we are successful on the spreadsheet and not successful with their it  systems , then the other alternative is to build our own reporting system . it  would be similar to a database where the recordsets are replaced by excel  workbooks . it can be constructed in such a way as to enable us to run  simulations and queries , but this would probably take me about five or six  weeks .  finally , don hawkins does operational audits for enron ' s physical assets .  he sends out teams to audit our pipelines and strategic assets . i don ' t  think that he does it for ees , but you might want to give him a call anyway .  - kevin k .  ps : the ees lunch meeting has been moved to wednesdays . jay hachen will  know more ."

4008,"Subject: sddp model  john ,  attached is a copy of the sddp methodology manual , written by the  developers . the model was developed by mario pereira , who is the proprietor  of psri ( power systems research inc ) in rio de janeiro . their web site is :  www . psr - inc . com where you can find more information about the company and  contact details . mario and most of the staff speak english , so phone calls  are possible .  development of sddp was originally done on a world bank contract to compare  the benefits of new generation and transmission system interconnections in  central america . it has since found much wider application . the code runs  on a pc , and is licensed to a number of consultants , power companies , etc .  while i was with ecnz in wellington , new zealand , we purchased a copy around  1994 .  the model works with weekly or monthly time steps , with a time horizon of  from 1 to 10 years , for mid to long range planning of hydro thermal power  systems . it represents loads in each period as from one to five load blocks ,  so it is not a chronological model . this type of model can not handle  thermal plant ramp rates and similar chronological system constraints . i ' m  not sure how important that would be to you . the optimization phase of the  model takes into account hydrological uncertainty using a form of stochastic  dynamic programming with sampling . this phase sets up a function for water  value in each large reservoir in the system . the simulation phase uses a  number of hydrological outcomes to collect statistics on how the system would  operate . the water values can be used with the short term optimization mode  of sddp or in some other more detailed short term optimization model .  most constraints found in hydro systems can be modelled . many transmission  constraints can be modelled . a dc load flow option can be used to determine  bus nodal prices .  a visual basic user interface is provided which reads and writes text files .  if you ' d like to know more about sddp , you could call me here in houston .

 b ) chemicals , plastics and refined products  ) we have asked jim ajello to  lead the coverage activities in this business . this group will be  responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the  chemicals and refined products industries ;  c ) non - integrated industrials  ) bruce garner , formerly leader of bankers  trust  , s global metals and mining group in london , has joined ena to lead the  coverage activities in this business . this group will be responsible for the  provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining ,  heavy manufacturing , industrial gases , fertilizers , transportation , textiles  and glass manufacturing industries .  midstream coverage / origination  a ) eastern coverage / origination  ) this group  , activities will focus on  energy , finance and power development solutions for electric and gas  utilities , municipals , co - ops and energy service companies in the eastern  interconnect . we have asked janet dietrich to assume the leadership of this  group ;  b ) western coverage / origination  ) this group  , s activities will focus on  energy , finance and power development solutions for electric and gas  utilities , municipals , co - ops and energy service companies in the wscc . they  will also continue to manage all qualified facilities ( qf ) restructuring  opportunities in the western u . s . we have asked chris calger to assume the  leadership of this coverage group . chris will relocate to portland from  calgary where he currently leads the canadian downstream origination efforts ;  c ) ipp merchant coverage / origination  ) this group  , s activities will focus on  the provision of structured energy , finance and asset solutions for the  emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio  , s of merchant  power generation either through development or acquisition . we have asked  mike miller to assume the leadership of this group . in addition , mike will  continue to manage the power development activities in the eastern  interconnect ;  d ) eastern qf restructuring  ) this group will focus on the qf restructuring  opportunities in the eastern interconnect including the existing  restructuring and re - capitalization of the east coast power assets . we have  asked dave duran to assume the leadership of this business . greg blair ,  formerly of enron asia  , s development group , doug clifford , formerly of  citizens power , and dick lydecker , formerly of cogen technology , will join  this newly formed business .  2 ) commercial transactions :  the commercial transactions group ( ctg ) , co - headed by ray bowen and jeff  donahue , was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of  transactions within ena  ) and thereby , improve ena  , s efficiency in executing  transactions and free - up the origination groups to increase their intensity  of client coverage . ctg consists of six primary functions : transaction  development , capital structuring and portfolio management , commodity  structuring and transportation , transactional support / accounting , technical  analysis and upstream asset management .  the transaction development group will be responsible for deal leadership ,  execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction  with the originator . the function will be divided into four teams , each of  which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups . this  dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link , better service  and greater accountability with the origination groups ; however , the ctg  resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to  the highest value transactions across the coverage functions :  a ) midstream transaction development will be dedicated to the eastern and  western coverage / origination groups . the senior members of this group  include billy lemmons , george mccormick , erin norris and russ porter . billy  lemmons joined enron in 1992 . most recently , he was the vice - president of  capital structuring and risk management for ees . russ porter joins us today  from dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power  origination .  b ) downstream transaction development will be dedicated to ena  , s industrial  origination efforts in pulp and paper , petrochemicals and refining ,  environmental energy , metals and mining and other industries as coverage is  established . the senior members of this team include rodney malcolm , jay  boudreaux , finley biggerstaff and chris helfrich . we anticipate announcing  two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks .  c ) generation transaction development will be dedicated to the ipp merchant  services and power plant development and qf restructuring groups . the senior  members of this team include thomas suffield , andy kelemen , kelly mahmoud and  john house . thomas suffield joined enron in 1996 . most recently , he was the  vice - president of origination for the latin american group in azurix . we  anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few  weeks .  d ) upstream transaction development will be dedicated to the producer  finance , coal and gas assets groups . the senior members of this team include  brad dunn , john curtin and chris hilgert . we hope to announce the addition  of at least one vp to this group prior to yearend .  ray bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the upstream and  downstream transaction development teams with jeff donahue having primary  responsibilities for the midstream and generation teams . andrea reed will  continue to head capital structuring and portfolio management : all junior  commercial resources within the transaction development teams will have dual  responsibilities to both their transaction development teams and to the  capital structuring group . the remaining four groups within ctg will remain  largely unchanged . in addition , the origination and the transaction  development teams and their respective origination groups will be located  together .  we believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverage  and industry knowledge in all ena  , s markets particularly in the industrial  markets . it will also provide a closer partnership and accountability between  the coverage / origination groups and the ctg groups .  please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in north  america by working with us to implement these changes ."

5621,"Subject: short term private firm model : static historical  snapshot + performance data for model development  mike , scott , eric ,  after brainstorming and discussing further on data here , we think that our final specifications for modelling data requirement need to be as follows :  we need bankrupt , default and nondefault ( which covers nonbankrupt ) accounts with 4 quarterly observation snapshots and 12 months performance following the latest snapshot . monthly performance indicator need to be available for the entire 12 months performance period . we will need all the bankrupt and default accounts and comparable sample of good accounts with weights .  for the purpose of model validation , we will need data with above specs covering 16 months of performance . this means that we will need rolling ( 4 quarterly snapshots + 12 months performance ) data for 4 monthly shifts :  input snapshots performance  1999 march end , 1999 june end , 1999 september end , 1999 december end 12 month end performance for jan 2000 through dec 2000  1999 feb end , 1999 may end , 1999 august end , 1999 november end 12 month end performance for dec 1999 through nov 2000  1999 jan end , 1999 apr end , 1999 july end , 1999 october end 12 month end performance for nov 1999 through oct 2000  1998 december end , 1999 mar end , 1999 june end , 1999 september end 12 month end performance for oct 1999 through sep 2000  we will need bankruptcy chapterwise indicator , if available during the performance period . our definition of default is either bankruptcy or 90 + days delinquency on any trade credit .  we have also discussed the cost aspect and we think considering the big picture , it makes sense to spend the extra amount to get the right data for analysis .  please let me know your thoughts . this will require d & b to give us a modified quote and we could possibly move forward quickly .  regards ,  amitava"
4381,"Subject: re : convergence of the research model  i was curious about the accuracy of our credit reserve model as a function of  the  number of simulations we use . this question , i think , is not so important  when we  calculate credit reserve , because the assumptions underlying our model are  pretty  rough anyway ( here i mean the assumptions regarding price processes ,  correlations , etc . )  this question becomes more essential when we talk about calculating  sensitivities of the  credit reserve to various factors . when the magnitude of the sensitivity is  comparable  to the accuracy of calculation of the credit reserve , what is the accuracy of  such sensitivity ?  i performed a numerical experiment where i calculated the expected loss  for a simple portfolio with one counterparty ( sithe ind power ) for different  number of simulations ( 10 , 100 , 1000 , 10000 , 100000 ) using old research  credit model .  you can see how the result converges and the relative error ( compared to the  result for 100000 simulations which is assumed to be the most accurate ) in  the  attached file .  tanya ."

4659,"Subject: re : storage model : simple issues  brad ,  here are my thoughts on your concerns .  * you needs curve inputs . this is an it job . i can help you for the curves  before the system is properly set up .  * intrinsic value vs time value :  the intrinsic value depends on how you allocate the volumes . if you have a  rough idea about the allocation as  you did in the spreadsheet , we can calucate the intrinsic value within the  model . the difference between the  total and the intrinsic will be the ( option ) time value . however , by  pre - allocating volumes , you killed some options .  in the storage model , volumes are allocated dynamically , therefore it is  hard to distinguish the intrinsic vs . time value .  * factor of loading : factor of loadings are used to give historical  correlation matrix . the three factors correspond to  paralle shift , slopping and curveture . the covariance matrix in the model  is expressed in the form  covar = row ( vol _ { i } ) * ( correl ( i , j ) ) * colum ( vol _ { j } ) where vols are  the implied volatilities from the vol curve .  ( correl ( i , j ) ) = l * l ' + residue ( small )  where l is the factor of loading matrix . so in a simple words , the factor of  loadings ( say , 60 x 3 ) are a simplier way for us to  remember the historical correlation matrix ( say , 60 x 60 ) .  let me know if i can offer further help .  zimin  brad horn 02 / 15 / 2000 07 : 15 am  to : zimin lu / hou / ect @ ect  cc : sandra henderson / hou / ect @ ect  subject : storage model : simple issues  zimin :  thanks for your time with the revised storage valuation . your right to  point out the similarity to market bids . here are some basic questions tied  to implementation and calibration :  model infrastructure / it support : i obviously need to re - build my link to the  forward curves as the model is not working in my new location . short - term  ( aprox 1 month ) , i ' d like to establish a link to the ena database egsprod 32  in order to fetch the long - dated price and volatility curves . my link to ena  forward curves would then be quickly severed in favor of the curves generated  by the new bridgeline entity ( database name and data structure yet to be  defined ) . however , its not clear to me what is required in this two stage  process to support your model . any definition of model input or minimum  support requirements you provide is appreciated . i ' ll then work with sandra  henderson , an enron employee providing our it support , to ensure the model  continues to work regardless any downstream system changes that may take  place as we build and establish our separate trading systems or databases .  meanwhile , is there anything you think you can do to ensure im up and running  quickly ?  sandra : linking excel spreadsheets to bridgeline forward curves will be key  to all our pricing projects , not just the storage model supplied by research .  intrinsic vs extrinsic value : it would be helpful to decompose the model ' s  calculated storage price and to distinguish intrinsic vs extrinsic ( time or  option ) value . i could easily link a new spreadsheet tab to your model  inputs and to calculate the intrinsic value , and then through a simple  difference i could determine the extrinsic value . ive included a simple  spreadsheet calculation for the intrinsic value for review . i wanted to  share this with you to ask the following :  does the nature of the model define intrinsic and extrinsic value differently  than the simple difference proposed ?  do you think it would make sense to do the simple value decomposition in the  backcode c - code via . dll in order to ensure run - time is faster ?  my goal here is straightforward : a ) to better understand the model and its  sensitivities . ; and b ) to determine if and when the option approach is  associating significant value above and beyond the simple present value of  the time spreads .  factor loadings : what are some of the thoughts or insights you can offer with  regards to factor loadings and how i should interpret the graph of the 3  factors calculated ? factor loadings have always been a mystery to me . for  example , what problems should i be looking for as a warning against  mispricing ? what , if anything , is implied about 1 day price change or  expected curve re - shapings ( after all , curve - reshapings are key to storage  valuation ! ! ! ) ?  calibration : we are preparing a simple summary of descriptive statistics  which should allow me to refine some of the model inputs . i ' ll share the  data when we are and model results once im up and running ."

( b ) how enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with  market . this is in many ways the critical aspect of real options that  most finance people miss - - having options is one thing but exercising them  and realizing their value is another . all of the incomplete contracting ,  asymmetric information , and incentive issues are ignored in real options  valuation models . but they are real in practice . my impression is enron ' s  real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate  these problems by imposing a market disciplining .  ( c ) how enron manages the various books that involve physicals , financials ,  credit etc . this is specially important when many of the real assets have  options features and therefore , include non - linear risk profiles . the  story of gas is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets  enron has been moving into over the last few years .  on the gmii front , i think that some interesting opportunities arise when  you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber . i am  working with several people at lucent on this issue . i think it would be  wonderful to engage in a conversation with enron and lucent folks in the room .  i can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues . perhaps we can discuss  some of these over a conference call . clearly , having vince kaminski in the  room would be very important to me .  as for schedules , the first 3 weeks of april are horrible . april 26 / 27 ,  may 3 / 4 are good for me .  regards  nalin  at 06 : 56 pm 03 / 22 / 2001 , mack , iris wrote :  > hi ,  >  > as we briefly discussed , i spoke with one of my colleagues ( dr .  > martin lin ) about your visiting enron to give a talk and to spend some  > time with us to discuss you work in telecommunications , real options ,  > etc .  >  > martin and i are working on various broadband related problems .  >  > we thought it might be helpful if you let us know a bit more about  > the following :  > * when you want to come ( the research group has weekly  > catered lunch on thursday and brown bag lunches on every other friday ) .  >  > * a description of what you want to talk about with respect  > to telecoms , broadband , etc .  > * who you would like to meet with me - vince kaminski ( our  > boss ) , any other of our colleagues in research , broadband , etc .  > . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . etc .  >  >  >  >  > look forward to hearing from you .  >  > regards ,  > iris"

5085,"Subject: adaptive trade  vince , zimin ,  i participated in a telephone conference on this company this morning . there  was a possibility enron would invest in it .  their product appears to be a gui interface over the top of ilog solver ( and  possibly ilog cplex ) which allows problems to be expressed in high level  terms . i do not see any immediate application at enron , but i am interested  in the concepts used so expressed an interest in a demo . maybe it would be  useful for general modelling projects here .  they do not even have a user manual for their software , so it will be  difficult to figure out what it does unless a demo is arranged . the  possibility for growth in the company seems small as the ilog software is a  modest size market and their product is aimed at only a small part of that  market . i think the scheduling tools in sap , i 2 , etc are more likely to  succeed than this one as they are already integrated into an information  system .  because of the small market for this software , the many competitors , the  absence of any clear use for it at enron and the early stage of development ,  there is very little prospect of us funding this company .  tom"

4284,"Subject: comments  hi sheridan ,  how are you ? i hope that you had a good vacation . vasant and i looked at  your memo and found it to be interesting . i shall first briefly summarize  our understanding of the methodology you propose . the comments follow .  finally , i shall sketch a simple gas field project you can use as a test case  in further refining the model .  it appears that you are proposing a state - space approach where probabilities  of different states at various future dates are specified . the next step is  to assume a discount rate and to compute the present value by following the  branches from the origin to one of the terminal points . traversing through  the tree in this manner over many iterations will permit us to compute the  average present value of the project . also , you are using the simulation to  assign a value of the project to each node . thus each node will have a cash  flow associated with it which will occur if the node is reached and a value  which is an expectation of the value to be realized going forward . if some  of these values turn out to be negative , zero - coupon , risk - free bonds are  purchased to neutralize the negative realization .  next , we find a comparable and apply the expected rate of return back to our  project ( based on the variance of the returns ) . we iterate until  convergence .  finally , we subtract the initial investment and the computed risk capital  from the pv of the gross cash flows ( including debt ) to determine if the  project merits further consideration .  comments / clarifications  1 . the money is being set aside to avoid negative values . it is not clear  if you mean the values of the cash flow or the pv at the node . anyhow , we  shall be setting aside money not just for that specific node but all nodes at  that cross - section of time as the risk - free asset pays in all states of  nature . this will have to be done every time there is a negative  realization . thus , for the typical project we have , the value of risk  capital may be extremely high , as we are not following a tail - based norm  anymore .  2 . your memo appears to suggest that debt capacity is contingent on all  values being positive . if so , we are only issuing risk - free debt . also , a  project with a single negative value at each cross - section of time will not  have a positive debt capacity .  3 . it seems that our optimization argument is the discount rate , which is  obtained in each step from the comparison investment ( by equating the  variances ) . it is not clear if changing the discount rate will have such an  effect on the project variance so as to lead to a global convergence . also ,  our project has a finite life and the market - based assets will have infinite  lives . in the light of this fact , how will we define the relevant variance ?  is it the spot variance of the returns of the comparison investment ?  4 . finally , our criterion is to subtract from the average pv the investment  and also the risk capital . setting risk capital to zero , this model closely  resembles the intuitive present value criterion and endogenously determines  the discount rate .  gas field case  to facilitate your thinking , we are providing a gas field example below .  we invest x million dollars to buy and develop a gas field . a profile of  expected production and variance of the production per year is available from  the engineers at the beginning . production will be autocorrelated , as the  profile will shift up or down based on the actual gas reserves being more or  less than the estimated reserves . we assume the life of the field to be 10  years with no salvage value . there are fixed and variable operating costs .  it might be useful for you to think about applying the framework to this  problem .  do let me know if you have further questions .  rakesh"

""  i waited patiently . i knew boys like to play . they ' d come to me in  their own time .  on day two , the oldest two were doing summersaults over my lap .  the youngest , ben , took a little longer , but yesterday he raced me  across the yard thirty times and won every time .  the weekend brought back memories of my own childhood . we had  such imaginations . in our minds , a tree was a tower to spot  approaching bad guys , a big rock became a mountain , a fallen log a  space ship headed to the stars . we had toys , but we had to use our  imagination , not like the new toys i see my grandkids with .  our toys didn ' t talk , and if they did , you pulled a string to  make it work . we had blocks to build , crayons to create , trucks and  cars to push . they were simple toys that required imagination . i  thought about the toys in my garage , the ones i saved , when my  children outgrew them . they were simple and needed their imagination  to work . mr . potato head allowed them to learn parts of the body and  giggle at the funny face with an ear where its mouth should have been .  i still have an old plastic phone . it has a dial to turn , a  bell that rings when you push a button , and that ' s it . it doesn ' t  talk , squawk , beep or move around the room . it ' s simple and was used  when they played house , nurse , doctor , and secretary .  i have a toy doctor ' s bag , with all the plastic doctor ' s tools .  i remember all the broken bones , cuts , bangs , scratches and aches my  daughter repaired as i lay in her office moaning .  most toys today do it all . we don ' t need imagination - - it  comes in a box . video games that take us into another world or  reality , talking toys , with vocabularies better than most people ,  computerized toys to teach the alphabet . kids sit and have  imagination brought to them . the teaching toys are great , but  children tire of them - - it ' s like being in school .  when my son was young and tired of his toys , he would come to me  and say , "" dad , i ' m bored .

( gtts ) be the next stock to rock ?  recently ,  we read an article in the economist that highlighted online gaming and  how it has become a socially acceptable form of entertainment . over the  next few days , as we thought about what sort of impact this trend could  have , we started to notice that online gambling was being discussed all  over the media - in newspapers , online and on television . it became  obvious to us that more and more people were jumping on the internet to  bet on games . we also came across some staggering statistics .  merrill lynch , for example , has predicted that gambling has the  potential to account for a full 1 % of global economic activity ! another  source , ecommercetimes . com , recently reported that the scope of this  business is so enormous that some have even claimed that it is the  single most important factor in the growth of e - commerce . the online  gaming industry , in other words , appears to be booming , and it may be  an ideal time to is time to invest .  we decided to  find out who the key players were in the business . after speaking with  a number of industry insiders , the trail led us to an emerging ,  publicly traded company called gaming transactions inc . ( ggts ) . after a  close look at ggts , we decided that this company could produce huge returns on investment in the upcoming months .  although  ggts is a new company , it has some surprisingly experienced players at  the helm an uncommon thing to find in an industry only ten years old .  the company has come out with online versions of the addictive game keno .  and its management team was smart enough to secure the rights to the  keno . com website , which , if youre marketing keno , is as good as it  gets . keno has the widest spread for the house of any mainstream  gambling game . ggts is also about to launch a suite of other online  gambling games , including poker and sports - book betting . once it offers  these popular games , and given that it already has keno . com online , the  company could bring in great revenues , attracting a lot of attention in  the investment community and driving up its stock price .  after a successful north american launch ,  gaming transactions inc . ( gtts ) has translated its games into chinese  and is about to hit asia . this initiative looks like a wise business  decision : many analysis anticipate that china will be the biggest  source of online gambling revenue by 2007 , so the company could be poised for massive expansion in terms of both profits and global reach .  what  does all this tell us ? a brand new company , a popular , well - known game ,  one of the biggest spreads for the house , a growing market , experienced  management , and a stock price that is trading under a dollar it adds up to the potential for huge gains for early investors . if youre interested in more information on the market and gaming transactions inc . , click here to read a free ten - page report . . .  to join market movers mailings http : / / ggtsstock . com to find out more .  first source data inc .  4535 west sahara ave # 217  las vegas nevada 89102  disclosure and disclaimer  investment news indepth reports ( hereinafter inir ) , operated by first  source data , inc .

2070,"Subject: 75 % reduction in road accidents  august , 2002  dear sir / madam ,  in case you have received this mail earlier , kindly ignore this mail . it may have  been re - sent to you by mistake . ours is not a mailing list and we have no intention of sending any regular mails to anybody .  we have devised a set of systems , which can reduce the damage caused to vehicles and deaths and injury caused to passengers and pedestrians in vehicular accidents by more than  seventy - five percent  we have already filed and are in process of filing further , multiple and appropriate disclosure documents , provisional patent applications at the united states patent & trademarks office ( uspto ) , and also applications under the patent co - operation treaty at world intellectual property organization ( wipo ) at geneva .  there is absolutely no doubt that our idea is new and innovative . moreover , we are very confident and very sure that this will help reducing / minimizing human suffering to a very large extent . there is no doubt that the product devised by us will change the face of the earth forever . brief details relating to our product are detailed in the annexures under the following headings :  statistics advantages  options  economics  we are looking for the followings :  01 . business consultancy and advice regarding the most viable , practical and profitable course of action under the circumstances and also consultancy on patents one person moderately injured every three seconds ; one person mildly injured every three seconds . )  ( c ) current yearly automobile sales worldwide - more than 1000 billion us $ .  ( d ) number of automobiles worldwide - more than 1000 billion pieces  ( e ) daily loss caused due to vehicular accidents worldwide  more than 2 billion us $ per day .  ( 2 % of the worldwide gross national product of more than 36500 billion us $ = more than 730 us $ per year = more than 2 billion us $ per day )  theadvantages of the technology developed by us :  a . the introduction of such technology will dramatically reduce the expenses of auto - insurance . this reduction of insurance cost will be at par with or even more that the expenses incurred towards the introduction of such technology in modern day vehicles . accordingly , the life insurance premier will also undergo drastic reduction . additionally , because of saving of lives , the outgo of the insurance companies will reduce substantially .  b . as per the who studies and projections , road accidents occupy the number nine positions by way of causes of death in the world today . it is projected by who that by the year 2020 they will occupy the number three positions , next only to heart disease and depression .  by introduction of this technology , we are sure that this will not happen . on the contrary there will be massive reduction in the number of deaths due to road accidents and road accidents may not figure on the list of major causes of death , in the year 2020 at all .  c . this technology will therefore , make all vehicles cheaper and safer . not only will the cost be reduced , safety which is priceless in itself , will also be greatly enhanced .  as and when the regular patent application is filed and patent is granted , the life of the patent will be 20 years . even at the current levels , with road accidents placed at number nine on the who list as a major cause of death , there is a daily loss of two billion us $ . even at the present level , over a period of twenty years , without any interest and without any compounding , this loss works out to be :  2 billion us $ x 365 days x 20 years - 14 , 600 billion us $ .  d . our technology will ensure that at least seventy - five percent of the above losses are prevented . such figure works out to be more that 10 , 000 billion us $ . it is important to note that this is the projection at the current level . as per the future projections , the incidents of road accidents are expected to increase . hence , the figure is likely to be increase very substantially . in addition the time factor and the interest factor will inflate this figure further .  e . at the current levels , more than 1 . 2 million persons are dying every year due to road accidents . even at the current rates , more than 24 million lives will be lost in road accidents over the next twenty years ( i . e . life of the patent , when granted ) . besides , at the current levels .  3 . 2 million people are injured every year . in the next twenty years , the number of people injured due to road accident , will therefore be more than half a billion .  f . if we add to that the personal , physical and psychological traumas to those directly involved in and also to those who are associated with the people involved in the road accidents . the trauma and the misery and henceforth the value of the savings , are all unmeasurable in quantities , presently known to human kind .  g . considering the figures and dynamics as explained hereinabove , it may not be improper or out of place to compare this technology with the introduction of electricity , computer or aircrafts in terms of its value to mankind .  h . the benefits of this technology will be so obvious and essential that , in the very near future , the use of this technology will become unavoidable . it should and will become mandatory by law , to install such technology and the installation of such technology should and will be a pre - requisite for granting or renewal of the registration and license of all vehicles in future .  i . as described hereinabove ; this technology and its utility are incomparable , outthought of , and unheard of till date . it will open a new floodgate in human travel and safety measures . in future , it can and will be applied to other mode of transport , like aircrafts and trains also .  . among other things , we have the following options available to us : - options  available to us : -  a - outright sale  ( a ) immediate outright sale of the idea and the concept along with our filed applications for one time lump sum consideration .  ( b ) further development of the concept and further filing of patent and all patent related applications , before taking steps as outlined in "" a "" .  the process ( b ) will obviously increase the realization in terms of price .  b - licencing options  i ) new vehicles - granting of licenses to manufacturers of automobiles , individually or collectively , all over the world for incorporation in the automobiles to be manufactured in future on fixed time or per piece basis .  ii ) conversion of existing vehicles - to independent agents for conversion of the existing more than 1000 billion vehicles all over the world .  c - combined options  a collaborative arrangement with some private and / or government agency wherein we receive a certain down payment and then jointly distribute the licensing rights on a pre - decided sharing ( partnership ) arrangement .  the economics of the project will be as follows : -  1 ) in case any / all processes and systems described by us are incorporated in the design of new vehicles and the new vehicles are manufactured in accordance with the modified designs , the cost escalation may not be more than 5 % to 8 % , and the safety and the protection will be ten times ( more than ) the price escalation . hence , drop in insurance premier will compensate for the cost escalation .  2 ) in case , the existing vehicles are modified , the cost involved will be approximately 10 % to 15 % of the value of the vehicle .  but partial modifications at a lower cost , which will give partial protection , may also be carried out . as a thumb rule , the cost of modification in percentage terms will be about one fifth of the percentage of safety and protection provided .  3 ) in case the value of the vehicles is low or the life of the vehicle is about to expire , the partial modifications may be practically and economically viable , as incorporation onto a new vehicle is relatively less expensive and more protective .  4 ) there are more than 1000 billion motor vehicles in the world at present . besides there are an unspecified number of non - motorized ehicles .  5 ) almost all of them can be converted in phased manner to a variable degree . the cost of conversion will be directly proportional to their current market value and the safety shield to be generated there from .  6 ) among the motorised vehicles , the conversion cost may work out of few dollars for every percent of safety shield created the exact calculation can be worked out , but over all , some of the methods may provide more safety at lower cost compared to the other which may differ in efficiency .  7 ) even if we consider a very vague and approximate cost of conversion of 300 us $ per vehicle , the conversion industry works out to be worth 3 , 00 , 000 billion us $ .  8 ) realising the potential of the product in terms of human safety , it will be reasonable to presume that majority of such conversion will be completed over a period of three years from the starting date .  9 ) as pointed hereinabove , the size of the conversion industry may be estimated to , in the range of 1 , 00 , 000 billion us $ per year over the next three years .  10 ) alternatively , considering the diversity of available motorised vehicles all over the world , conversion licensing can also be commercially viable proposition . for such conversion , licenses can be granted on - line , on receipt of on - line payments . in that case , different rates for granting conversion to vehicles having specific registration numbers can be granted in accordance with and in proportion to the size , carrying capacity and the engine power of the vehicle .  11 ) in case , licensing is done , the creation and installation of the concerned systems will be done by the end - user , as per his circumstances and needs . however , piracy is likely to be a major problem in such licensing .  12 ) it is likely that as and when the systems are introduced in the motorised vehicles , unusual and unprecedented demand of new vehicles is created . this will result in massive rejection of the vehicles currently playing all over the world and stimulate an entirely new market as far as motorised vehicle is concerned . the size of such market is difficult to either comprehend and / or estimate .  p . s .  1 ) some of the figures have been rounded off but generally the figures are correct .  2 ) we have tried to keep this communication brief and to the point . more details , including website references are available with us and can be provided , if required .

( although it will probably be clear from our discussions the  model ( s ) we ? prefer ) . we therefore try and give ? as clear account as possible  of the advantage and disadvantages of all the ? models so that the reader can  make an informed choice as to the models which ? best suit their needs .  in order to meet our objectives the ? book is divided into 11 chapters . ? in  chapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to ?  model and  price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the ? book . in  addition to introducing ? the techniques that underlie the black - scholes  modelling framework we outline ? the numerical techniques of trinomial trees  and  monte carlo simulation for ? derivative pricing , which are used throughout the  book .  in chapter 2 we discuss the ? analysis of spot energy prices . as ? well as  analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes ? that  can  be used to model the prices . ? we look at the well - know process of geometric  brownian motion as well as ? mean reversion , stochastic volatility and jump  processes , discussing each and ? showing how they can be simulated and their  parameters estimated .  chapter 3 , written by vince ? kaminski , grant masson and ronnie chahal of  enron  corp . , discusses volatility ? estimation in energy commodity markets . ? this  chapter builds on the previous one . it examines in detail the methods , ?  merits  and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different ? pricing  models introduced in chapter 2 . ? examples from crude , gas , and electricity  markets are used to illustrate ? the technical and interpretative aspects of  calculating volatility .  chapter 4 examines forward curves ? in the energy markets . although ? such  curves  are well understood and straight - forward in the most financial ? markets , the  difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well ? defined  curves .  in this chapter we ? describe forward price bounds for energy prices and the  building of forward ? curves from market instruments . we ? outline the three  main  approaches which have been applied to building forward ? curves in energy  markets ; the arbitrage approach , the econometric approach , and ? deriving  analytical values by modelling underlying stochastic factors .  chapter 5 presents an overview of ? structures found in the energy derivative  markets and discusses their uses . examples of products analysed in this  chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors and collars , as well as  energy  swaptions , compound options , asian options , barrier options , lookback  options ,  and ladder options .  chapter 6 investigates single and ? multi - factor models of the energy spot  price  and the pricing of some standard ? energy derivatives . closed form ? solutions  for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option prices ? both on  the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the models in ? this  chapter including a three factor , stochastic convenience yield and interest  rate model .  chapter 7 shows how the prices of ? path dependent and american style options  can  be evaluated for the models in ? chapter 6 . simulation schemes are ? developed  for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a variety ? of  path  dependent options . in order ? to price options which incorporate early  exercise  opportunities , a trinomial ? tree scheme is developed . this tree ? is built to  be  consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to ? price exotic  as  well as standard european and american style options .  chapter 8 describes a methodology ? for valuing energy options based on  modelling  the whole of the market observed ? forward curve . the approach results ? in a  multi - factor model that is able to realistically capture the evolution of a  wide range of energy forward curves . ? the user defined volatility structures  can be of an extremely general ? form . closed - form solutions are ? developed  for  pricing standard european options , and efficient monte carlo ? schemes are  presented for pricing exotic options . the chapter closes with a discussion of  the valuation of american style options .  chapter 9 focuses on the risk ? management of energy derivative positions . ?  in  this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions ? that  trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the problem ?  of  managing the risk through time . ? we begin with delta hedging a portfolio  containing derivatives and look ? at extensions to gamma hedging ?  illustrating  the techniques using both spot and ? forward curve models . the general ? model  presented in chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi - factor hedging of a ?  portfolio  of energy derivatives and this is also discussed .  chapter 10 examines the key risk ? management concept of value at risk ( var )  applied to portfolios containing ? energy derivative products . after ?  discussing  the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs ? ( volatilities ,  covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . we then compare the fours  major ? methodologies for computing var ; delta , delta - gamma , historical  simulation and ? monte - carlo simulation , applying each to the same portfolio  of  energy ? options . in this chapter we also ? look at testing the var estimates  for  various underlying energy market ? variables .  finally , in chapter 11 we review ? modelling approaches to credit risk . ? we  look  in detail at two quite different approaches , creditmetrics ( j . p . morgan  ( 1997 ) )  and ? creditrisk + ( credit suisse financial ? products ( 1997 ) ) for which  detailed  information is publicly available . together these provide an extensive set ?  of  tools with which to measure credit risk . we present numerical examples of  applying these techniques to energy derivatives .  before ? we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this  book  are tools ? which should be used with the benefit of an understanding of how  both  the ? tool ? ? and the market works . the ? techniques we describe are certainly  not  ? magic wands ? which can be waved at ? data and risk management problems to  provide instant and perfect solutions . to quote from the riskmetrics  technical  document ? ? no amount of sophisticated analytics will replace experience and  professional judgement in managing risk . ? . ? however , the right tools ,  correctly  used make the job a lot ? easier !"

5690,"Subject: linux - - hit or miss ?  network world fusion focus : phil hochmuth  on linux  today ' s focus : will linux be a hit or miss on the corporate desktop ?  03 / 15 / 00  dear wincenty kaminski ,  today ' s focus : will linux be a hit or miss  on the corporate desktop ?  by phil hochmuth  so far this year , the buzz about linux in enterprise networks has  focused on servers and embedded systems , with the growth of linux  severs being most heralded . according to idc , a research firm based in  framingham , mass . , linux was the fastest - growing server operating  system last year , with a 93 % growth rate over the year before . linux  was the second most - shipped operating system in 1999 after windows nt ,  capturing 24 % of new licenses shipped .  as for the embedded market , linux has emerged as an ideal platform for  network appliances , because the system can be modified to handle  specialized , dedicated tasks very well . companies such as cobalt  networks , picazo and progressive systems have announced linux - based  appliances , ranging from web servers to pbxs to firewalls .  but what of the open source hacker  , s dream of  & linux on every desktop ?  8  sure , linux on the desktop has become more accessible than ever , with  colorful , shrink - wrapped boxes of caldera , red hat and corel linux now  available at places like compusa . however , analysts have said that  linux  , s growth in the enterprise will be limited to the macro and micro  areas of network servers and embedded operating systems .  according to idc , linux currently runs on only 4 % of u . s . desktops . the  hold microsoft windows has on the desktop market will remain strong ,  analysts say , despite such factors as microsoft  , s antitrust problems  and the surging popularity of linux .  even some linux executives are skeptical of their product  , s desktop  future . recently , suse ceo roland dyroff downplayed linux  , s future on  desktops . dyroff said ,  & given the lack of applications available , we  really can ' t claim it as being competitive on the desktop yet .  8  a recent survey by survey . com gives more hope for linux desktops .  according to the survey of 1 , 640 enterprise network managers , open  source operating systems are used on 10 % of desktops , with the number  jumping to a surprising 23 % of enterprise desktops by 2002 .  despite the mix of numbers being thrown around , two important factors  that will determine the success of linux as an enterprise client  desktop are : a standardized , easy - to - use graphical user interface ( gui )  and available applications .  one company that is working to make linux more user friendly is palo  alto - based eazel , which is designing a next - generation file management  system and user interface to run on top of the linux kernel . according  to eazel  , s web site , the company  , s goal is to bring linux to the masses  and  & do it in a way that appeals to today ' s linux users and to mere  mortals .  8  the company was founded by a group of former apple executives , and is  allied with the gnome project , which has been doing extensive linux  desktop environment development for several years . eazel is due to have  a product out by the middle of this year . with an intuitive , icon - based  file management environment , eazel is hoping its user interface will be  an improvement over the two current linux guis , gnome and kde , and will  help standardized the look and feel of linux for  & regular  8 users . for  enterprise mangers who have already embraced linux on the server side ,  this development will be worth keeping an eye on .  on the applications side , several office productivity suites have been  available for some time , such as sun  , s staroffice suite and koffice for  the kde desktop . corel has also ported its office products , such as  wordperfect , over to linux to complement its own distribution of the  operating system . while there have been recent rumors ( started by linux  care vice president arthur tyde ) that microsoft is working on a port of  ms office to linux , microsoft officials deny this .  while linux may never supplant windows as the industry - standard desktop ,  there should be plenty of opportunity for linux pcs in enterprise nets  in the future .  to contact phil hochmuth :  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  phil hochmuth is a writer and researcher for network world , and a former  systems integrator . you can reach him at mailto : phochmut @ nww . com .  for related links - - click here for network world ' s home page :  http : / / www . nwfusion . com  staroffice software from sun  http : / / www . sun . com / staroffice  corel linux os  http : / / www . corel . com / freedom / freedom . htm  eazel  http : / / www . eazel . com  gnome - - the gnu network object model environment  http : / / www . gnome . org  koffice - - the integrated office suite for kde , the k desktop  environment  http : / / koffice . kde . org /  cobalt networks , inc .  http : / / www . cobaltnetworks . com  progressive systems  http : / / www . progressive - systems . com  picazo  http : / / www . picazo . com  other linux - related articles from network world :  active directory upgrade requires strong game plan , network world ,  03 / 13 / 00  subscription services  to subscribe or unsubscribe to any network world e - mail newsletters ,  go to :  to change your email address , go to :  subscription questions ?

( attached is a  summary of this issue . ) the board is expected to vote on this issue during  may 2001 . eei will be taking steps to appraise fasb of our concerns . if  you , or company cfo would like more information about this effort , please  contact richard mcmahon , executive director of the alliance of energy  suppliers , at rmcmahon @ eei . org , or at 202 -

wy ) ,  the first amendment would establish the electric energy market competition  task force to study competition in the wholesale and retail market for  electric energy in the united states . the task force would be made up of  representatives of ferc , the department of justice and the federal trade  commission , as well as non - voting representatives from the department of  agriculture and the securities and exchange commission . the amendment also  contained a provision , co - sponsored by sen . paul sarbanes ( d - md ) , that would  preserve ferc ' s authority to require that energy rates are reasonable and do  not include the pass - through of holding company costs that are unrelated to  energy .  another amendment , offered by sen . jon corzine ( d - nj ) , initiated a study by  the general accounting office of the success of federal and state governments  in preventing anticompetitive practices by public utility holding companies  and in promoting competition and efficient energy markets .  * * * institute   s tax agreement with public power again introduced on hill * * *  the tax agreement eei reached with the american public power association  ( appa ) and the large public power council ( lppc ) again has been introduced in  the house . the bill ( hr 1459 ) contains the same provisions as were in a  measure ( hr 4971 ) , with technical corrections , introduced during the 106 th  congress . hr 1459 was introduced by rep . j . d . hayworth ( r - az ) and nine  original co - sponsors from the ways and means committee .  hr 1459 contains four key provisions with tax code changes : 1 ) the tax - free  sale or spin - off of transmission assets into an rto is allowed , 2 ) nuclear  decommissioning laws are adapted to a competitive market by allowing  deductions to a trust fund no longer subject to cost - of service ratemaking ,  3 ) the contributions in aid of construction ( ciac ) tax on interconnections to  transmission and distribution facilities is eliminated , and 4 ) private use  tax rules are changed to permit open access to transmission and distribution  facilities .  the measure was referred to the house ways and means committee , and eei has  urged congress to act without delay in moving it forward . enactment will  help encourage a vigorous but fair competitive environment , the institute  noted . the same legislation has been incorporated into s 389 , senate energy  committee chairman frank murkowski ' s ( r - ak ) energy security bill , and  stand - alone legislation could also be introduced . hearings are expected to  be held in both the senate finance and house ways and means committees ,  probably after consideration of president bush ' s individual tax proposal .  administration / ferc  * * * white house seeks $ 2 trillion budget in fiscal year 2002 * * *  president bush last week transmitted a $ 2 trillion fiscal year 2002 budget  request to capitol hill . the administration noted that its proposal  * moderates recent explosive growth in discretionary spending to four percent  in 2002 , * an increase of $ 26 billion over the preceding fiscal year . the  budget bid contains a $ 231 billion total surplus in 2002 , and projects a $ 5 . 6  trillion surplus over the next ten years .  in the energy area , the administration noted the federal government   s  * longstanding and evolving role * in the sector , pointing out that most  federal energy programs and agencies have no state or private counterparts .  it proposed about $ 2 . 8 billion in discretionary spending for energy programs ,  and about $ 2 . 1 billion in tax benefits , * mainly to encourage development of  traditional and alternative energy sources . * doe   s budget request was $ 19 . 2  billion , including $ 2 . 3 billion for energy resources programs . this later  figure represents a decrease of $ 196 million , or 7 . 9 percent , from fiscal  year 2001 .  in the environmental sector , the administration sought some $ 7 . 3 billion in  discretionary funding for epa , including a $ 3 . 7 billion operating program  focused on implementation of most federal pollution control laws .  * * * success of restructuring tied to energy strategy , ferc   s massey asserts * * *  electric restructuring may be in jeopardy , and its success * is in the hands  of regulators and policymakers , * ferc commissioner william massey has  asserted . speaking at a recent national governors association policy forum  in philadelphia , commissioner massey urged officials to pay attention to the  key elements of a national energy strategy .  first , he specified , there is a need for an adequate supply of the energy  commodity . turning to a second element , commissioner massey told forum  attendees that * all the supply in the world won   t help unless it can be  delivered over an adequate , efficient , non - discriminatory network . *  commissioner massey identified market structure as the third essential  element of a national energy strategy , while citing an inherent difficulty :  that * good structure cannot be easily parsed between wholesale and retail  jurisdictions . * accordingly , he said , ferc and the states must work together  on market structure .  the final element of a successful energy strategy , the commissioner  specified , is the need for aggressive ferc intervention when markets fail to  do their job . * if the states cannot depend on the wholesale market regulator  to ensure reasonable prices for consumers , * he cautioned , they * will surely  think twice before heading down the restructuring path . *  new generation  * * * dynegy to build second plant in kentucky * * *  dynegy has announced plans to construct a new 330 megawatt plant adjacent to  the riverside generating project in lawrence county , kentucky . dynegy will  sell the power generated at the plant in the wholesale market . commercial  operation is expected to begin first quarter of 2002 .  * * * ppl to expand generation capacity * * *  ppl corporation this week said it would build a 540 megawatt power plant near  chicago and would increase the capacity of its susquehanna nuclear plant by  100 megawatts . ceo william hecht said the illinois plant is expected to be  in service by the summer of 2002 .  * * * constellation energy group announces eight new plants * * *  constellation energy group this week announced that the company is scheduled  to bring four peaking power plants on line this summer . additionally , four  larger power plants are scheduled to enter service in the following two  summers . the four peaking plants are located in illinois , pennsylvania ,  virginia and west virginia . the larger power plants are under construction  in california , florida , illinois , and texas .  * we   re building in these seven states because they serve regions where  wholesale electricity is needed and where we can provide energy to support  our national power marketing business , * said constellation energy group  chairman and ceo christian poindexter .  * * * california energy commission approves construction of otay mesa generating  plant * * *  pg & e corporation   s national energy group ( neg ) last week announced that the  california energy commission ( cec ) has approved construction of the otay mesa  generating plant in san diego county , which the neg has developed . the 500  megawatt project will produce enough electricity to power about 1 , 000 homes .  after the development process is completed , calpine corporation will assume  ownership of the project and will construct and operate the plant . neg will  contract for up to half the plants output .  energy data  * * * weekly electric output ( week 15 ) * * *  electric output reached 63 , 528 gwh for the week ending april 14 ( week 15 ) ,  with the highest increase over 2000 levels in the south central states , which  both had a 12 . 6 percent increase over 2000 for week 15 . year -

4829,"Subject: re : outage tracker option and background  karl ,  thanks a lot . i have passed this information to grant masson  who worked here on a related problem .  he will get in touch with you regarding this technology .  vince  karl tomlinson @ enron _ development  07 / 24 / 2000 06 : 00 pm  to : vince j kaminski @ ect  cc :  subject : outage tracker option and background  vince ,  to follow up on the idea of a means for effectively tracking instantanious  plant faliure utilising either system frequency or connection point voltage .  the system frequency phase shift across a network will probably be the best  option as this would allow alll significant deviations to be tracked along  with relative network performance from a few points .  i am currently chasing nemmco ( au system operator ) to get hold of a few weeks  of 4 second metering data for the whole system to see if there is enough  measurement consistency to prove one of the ideas .  the idea follows along the lines ( literally ! ) that when a unit fails it will  introduce a shock into the system and reduce system frequency , which is then  reacted to by frequency control services offered in by generators . the drop  in frequency is noticable across the whole network and as one option may  change the phase shift across the whole grid . the phase shift across the  network is constantly changing due to loads and power factor correctrion  devices switching on and off , however a unit failure may be distinct .  the second option relates to how a unit fails , whereby if a circuit breaker  is involved as in the case of uncontrolled shutdowns , then the outage will  cause an rf pulse that should propogate across some of the network .  transformers will attenuate the pulse , however it should be detectable many  miles away from the fault location . measure the arrival time at several point  on the network , work out the shift and backtrack on the network . part of the  solution is already proven in lightning trackers . the solution may be made  more simple by detecting the exact point on the sinewave that the unit failed  ( i . e . measuring the three phases at lmhz and then sending the data through a  dsp ) . this solution is more complex , however this should allow unit failure  to be pinpointed to a station . the timing base for each of the nodes may be  sourced from gps timing , self locating at the same time !  will send you some links and documents for potentail hardware and setups .  karl ."

2894,"Subject: power trading  hi folks :  very glad to hear about the new developments . just to recap what we  discussed this morning about different things you need to look into to set up  trading operations and the contacts :  1 . licence to trade : regulatory people : i guess you know about this part  better than me .  2 . trading & risk mgmt : global risk mgmt oversight : john sherrif in london  has the overall responsibility outside western hemisphere . research group can  help with the structuring models used for trading .  3 . risk conrols : before trading group is operational , it needs to get the  authorization from the board of directors of enron along with total position  limits and possibly value @ risk limits . these limits are typically by  commodity type and by region . risk assessment & control ( rac ) under rick buy  performs the internal control function ensuring that the businesses adhere to  these trading limits . ted murphy is the vp in rac overseeing the trading  operations . the value @ risk models come from the research group , but  day - to - day monitoring of the numbers is done by ted ' s group .  4 . credit risk : a credit reserve number is computed for each deal ( again , the  models are created by research ) and is transferred to the credit group under  bill bradford ( also in rac ) . this is basically like buying insurance from the  corp . , so that if there is a couterparty default , the loss is covered by the  reserve pool of the credit dept .  5 . legal : the name i was given is alan aronowitz for legal help .  6 . back office : initially can survive with excel spreadsheets . you should  contact the it though when the plans finalize to talk about systems .  australia is the most recent place where we set up the trading operations .  you can talk to paul quilky , the trader there to talk about these issues  ( mention to him that grant masson in research gave his name ) .  barry pierce in london was incharge of back office at the begin there .  i can coordinate for talking with people next week . give me a call monday if  possible . i hadn ' t the time to search for the presentation stuff today . will  do it next week .  krishna ."

is it the spot variance of the returns of the comparison  investment ?  * * this is a good point . i was thinking in terms of the average variance ,  but this may not be correct . actually , we know that this is just an  approximation and we need to think about whether or not it is a good  approximation . typically , firms tend to ignore issues relating to the  duration of their project cash flows when they determine discount rate ,  which clearly does not make sense . this requires some additional thought . * *  4 . finally , our criterion is to subtract from the average pv the  investment and also the risk capital . setting risk capital to zero , this  model closely resembles the intuitive present value criterion and  endogenously determines the discount rate .  * * this is correct . my goal was to come up with something that was closely  related to what you are already doing but which gives you some insight into  how to define risk capital and the appropriate discount rate . there are a  number of ways that we can refine and improve this procedure . what we need  to first consider is whether or not the basic approach makes sense for the  kind of projects that you are evaluating . * *  gas field case  to facilitate your thinking , we are providing a gas field example below .  we invest x million dollars to buy and develop a gas field . a profile of  expected production and variance of the production per year is available  from the engineers at the beginning . production will be autocorrelated , as  the profile will shift up or down based on the actual gas reserves being  more or less than the estimated reserves . we assume the life of the field  to be 10 years with no salvage value . there are fixed and variable  operating costs . it might be useful for you to think about applying the  framework to this problem .  * * this problem is probably pretty straightforward because it is unlikely  that the cash flows will be negative once the gas field is producing .  hence , there is no need to be concerned about risk capital ( other than the  x million dollars to buy and develop the property ) . to value the property  assuming all - equity financing we calculate the value process of the  developed project and compare its volatility to a comparison investment  whose value process is observable ( e . g . , a traded mlp ) . the risk - adjusted  return of the comparison investment would then be used to discount the cash  flows of the gas field .  please note that this procedure requires relatively strong assumptions and  calculating the risk - adjusted return on the comparison investment is not  necessarily straightforward . * *  let me know when you would like to discuss this .  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  on another topic , is it possible for you to give me information about one  case where enron bought or sold a base load power plant , where the  purchaser financed the transaction with non - recourse debt . we would like  the following information :  1 . the value of the power plant ( or purchase price )  2 . the amount of debt financing and the terms of the debt contract .  3 . some information about the pricing of gas - power swaps and options .  about a year ago i gave vince a paper which develops a pricing model for  project debt . i don ' t think he thought that it could be implemented on the  type of projects that enron finances . however , my coauthors would like to  try applying the model for one case study .  let me know when you want to discuss these issues .  thanks ,  sheridan  sheridan titman  department of finance  college of business administration  university of texas  austin , texas 78712 - 1179  512 - 232 - 2787 ( phone )  512 - 471 - 5073 ( fax )  titman @ mail . utexas . edu"

we believe that for practitioners this  last point is very important and we continue to stress in our articles and  presentations the dangers of having flawed risk management and giving  arbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using ad - hoc and inconsistent  models for different instruments and markets ( see also others who propose  consistent models ? ) . ? however , it is not our wish to concentrate on one  particular model or models , at the exclusion of the others because we  believe that the choice should rest with the user ( although it will probably  be clear from our discussions the model ( s ) we prefer ) . ? we therefore try and  give as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of all  the models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models  which best suit their needs .  ?  in order to meet our objectives the book is divided into 11 chapters . ? in  chapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model  and price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the book . ?  in addition to introducing the techniques that underlie the black - scholes  modelling framework we outline the numerical techniques of trinomial trees  and monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing , which are used throughout  the book .  ?  in chapter 2 we discuss the analysis of spot energy prices . ? as well as  analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes that  can be used to model the prices . ? we look at the well - know process of  geometric brownian motion as well as mean reversion , stochastic volatility  and jump processes , discussing each and showing how they can be simulated  and their parameters estimated .  ?  chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski , grant masson and ronnie chahal of  enron corp . , discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity markets . ?  this chapter builds on the previous one . ? it examines in detail the methods ,  merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different  pricing models introduced in chapter 2 . ? examples from crude , gas , and  electricity markets are used to illustrate the technical and interpretative  aspects of calculating volatility .  ?  chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . ? although such  curves are well understood and straight - forward in the most financial  markets , the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well  defined curves . ? in this chapter we describe forward price bounds for energy  prices and the building of forward curves from market instruments . ? we  outline the three main approaches which have been applied to building  forward curves in energy markets ; the arbitrage approach , the econometric  approach , and deriving analytical values by modelling underlying stochastic  factors .  ?  chapter 5 presents an overview of structures found in the energy derivative  markets and discusses their uses . ? examples of products analysed in this  chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors and collars , as well as  energy swaptions , compound options , asian options , barrier options , lookback  options , and ladder options .  ?  chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot  price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . ? closed form  solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option  prices both on the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the  models in this chapter including a three factor , stochastic convenience  yield and interest rate model .  ?  chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options  can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . ? simulation schemes are  developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a  variety of path dependent options . ? in order to price options which  incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is  developed . ? this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward  curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard european and  american style options .  ?  chapter 8 describes a methodology for valuing energy options based on  modelling the whole of the market observed forward curve . ? the approach  results in a multi - factor model that is able to realistically capture the  evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves . ? the user defined  volatility structures can be of an extremely general form . ? closed - form  solutions are developed for pricing standard european options , and efficient  monte carlo schemes are presented for pricing exotic options . ? the chapter  closes with a discussion of the valuation of american style options .  ?  chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions . ?  in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions  that trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the  problem of managing the risk through time . ? we begin with delta hedging a  portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging  )  illustrating the techniques using both spot and forward curve models . ? the  general model presented in chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi - factor  hedging of a portfolio of energy derivatives and this is also discussed .  ?  chapter 10 examines the key risk management concept of value at risk ( var )  applied to portfolios containing energy derivative products . ? after  discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs  ( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . ? we then  compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta , delta - gamma ,  historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation , applying each to the same  portfolio of energy options . ? in this chapter we also look at testing the  var estimates for various underlying energy market variables .  ?  finally , in chapter 11 we review modelling approaches to credit risk . ? we  look in detail at two quite different approaches , creditmetrics ( j . p . morgan  ( 1997 ) ) and creditrisk + ( credit suisse financial products ( 1997 ) ) for which  detailed information is publicly available . ? together these provide an  extensive set of tools with which to measure credit risk . ? we present  numerical examples of applying these techniques to energy derivatives .  ?  before we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this  book are tools which should be used with the benefit of an understanding of  how both the  + tool  , and the market works . ? the techniques we describe are  certainly not  & magic wands  8 which can be waved at data and risk management  problems to provide instant and perfect solutions . ? to quote from the  riskmetrics technical document  &  ( no amount of sophisticated analytics will  replace experience and professional judgement in managing risk .  8 . ? however ,  the right tools , correctly used make the job a lot easier !"

'  state govt . to renegotiate dabhol power project , by hubert vaz  the economic times , friday apr 27 2001  dpc board empowers md to cancel mseb contract  the enron power project crisis on thursday deepened with the board of dabhol  power company authorising the management to issue a termination notice to the  maharashtra state electricity board even while international lenders to the  project asked enron to renegotiate power purchase agreement signed with the  mseb .  the decision to authorise managing director neil mcgregor to issue "" notice of  termination on the contract to sell 740 mw of power "" was taken after the  board prevented mseb from voting on the ground that it was an interested  party . the decision was taken with six votes in favour and the single  opposition vote was cast by idbi , sources said .  according to reports , financial institutions such as anz investment bank ,  credit suisse first boston , citibank , abn - amro and the state bank of india  have on wednesday advised enron against terminating its ppa with mseb . mseb  chairman vinay bansal , who with two other directors attended the meeting on  wednesday representing maharashtra  , s 15 per cent stake in the near $ 3 - billion  project , said : "" the indian side told them that it would be unfortunate if  enron broke the contract . "" while bansal declined comment on the board  decision , the sources said the indian side had expressed its interest to  holds talks on the issue rather than terminating the project and there were  possibilities of a fresh power purchase agreement between the company and the  state . ( pti )  the economic times , friday apr 27 2001  mseb pays rs 134 cr under ' protest ' to dpc  despite the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head ,  maharashtra state electricity board on thursday made a "" protest payment "" of  rs 134 crore disputed amount , towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to  dabhol . "" we were ready with the payment on wednesday itself , but dpc  officials could not collect the cheque due to the statewide bandh "" , a senior  mseb official said . "" we have disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore and it would  be now taken up at the disputes resolution forum , of which enron india  managing director k wade cline and krishna rao are members "" , mseb sources  said .  last week , dpc had dashed off a communication to the government and mseb that  it would not accept "" protest payments "" anymore . cline had said the energy  major shall treat such payments as an election to pay the sums , which mseb in  fact owed dpc in full and that the company would also not recognise the  "" purported protest or reservation "" . mseb had paid a rs 113 . 5 crore february  bill in protest last month . on april 23 last , both domestic and international  lenders of dpc had met in london and held exhaustive discussions the  multinational ' s move to issue a termination notice to mseb and state  government . ( pti )  business standard , friday , april 27 , 001  enron india md authorised to terminate ppa  the board of the enron - promoted dabhol power company ( dpc ) , at its meeting in  london on wednesday , authorised the managing director of enron india to issue  a notice for terminating the power purchase agreement to the maharashtra  state electricity board and the state government .  & the board has authorised  wade cline to serve the termination notice . however , this does not mean that  the termination notice will be served immediately . it is only an enabling  provision and will be used only if the situation arises ,  8 a state government  source told business standard from london . he said dpc was under pressure  from its lenders .  the dpc spokesperson here refused to comment on the issue . the hardening of  the board  , s stand is in sharp contrast to the advice of dpc ' s lenders , who  had warned enron not to precipitate matters by issuing a termination notice .  the lenders had arrived at a consensus that the termination notice need not  be served at this stage . serving of the notice requires a nod from the  lenders , who have an exposure of about $ 2 billion in the project . sources  said given the lenders ' strong opposition to termination of the contract , the  enron board ' s "" enabling resolution "" did not have much significance beyond  conveying a hardening of its stand with regard to the current imbroglio . the  maharashtra chief minister had warned enron not to scuttle the process of  crisis resolution by issuing a termination notice . the state government is to  nominate an expert group to renegotiate the terms of the dabhol contract .  enron holds 65 per cent in dpc , while us - based ge and bechtel hold 10 per  cent each . the balance 15 per cent is held by mseb through a special purpose  vehicle , maharashtra power development corporation . the mseb representatives  were not allowed to vote at the meeting since they were an interested party .  the idbi representative protested against the board ' s decision . the meeting  was attended by state energy secretary vm lal . the meeting was held against  the backdrop of a dispute between mseb and dpc over payment of bills .  after mseb failed to pay rs 102 crore towards the december 2000 bill , dpc  invoked the state government ' s guarantee and then the union government ' s  counter guarantee . when payment of the rs 127 - crore january bill became  overdue , dpc again invoked the state government ' s guarantee . mseb retaliated  on january 28 , 2001 by slapping a rs 401 - crore penalty for non - supply of  electricity at adequate levels . it demanded that dpc adjust the bills against  this penalty . "" this stand of mseb was explained to dpc at the board meeting "" ,  a state government official said . the centre also supported mseb ' s stand and  refused to honour the counter guarantee . the power company then invoked the  political force majeure clause . a process of conciliation and arbitration  between the centre and dpc is currently on .  the financial express , friday , april 27 , 2001  foreign lenders slam brakes on disbursements to dpc , sanjay jog & raghu mohan  global banks comfortable with enron pull - out  lenders to the dabhol power company ( dpc ) are a sharply divided lot .  international lenders , in direct contrast to the stand taken by local ones  led by the the industrial develoment bank of india ( idbi ) , are categorical  that additional assistance to dpc  , s phase - ii will be held in abeyance despite  the completion of 92 per cent of the project work . the stage is also set for a  preliminary termination notice to be served by dpc to the maharashtra state  electricity board ( mseb ) within the next four weeks . this follows the  authorisation given to enron india  , s managing director k wade cline and dpc  president & ceo neil mcgregor to serve the termination notice , and transfer  notices to mseb , following wednesday  , s dpc board meeting in london .  the essence of the message from the international lenders following the  london meeting with dpc board is : emotions do not work . contractual  obligations and payments have to be met . we are convinced that the mseb has  failed to meet its obligations . there is no point in enron continuing with  the project and the company should get out of it . the structuring of dpc  , s  debt has created two classes of lenders . in phase - i , international lenders  are covered by a sovereign guarantee while in phase - ii , no lender is .  however , all lenders have a parri passu charge , making attachment of assets a  messy affair .  sources in international banks were quick to point out that local lenders to  phase - ii of the project are worried that an awry dpc project will affect  their interests more given that they have no security  * other than assets  *  like a sovereign cover .  & it was this desperation that made local lenders like  idbi slash the interest rates a few months back to 16 . 5 per cent from 21 . 5  per cent ,  8 a leading foreign banker pointed out . three points that were made  clear and stressed in no uncertain terms by international lenders were : a )  there are contractual obligations b ) mseb was not punctual in its payments to  dpc and c ) mseb adopted a confrontational position by slapping a rs 401 crore  rebate charge on dpc for misdeclaration and default on the availability of  power .  while local lenders led by idbi  * with mseb parroting the same  * were of the  view that the current situation is a temporary one , international lenders  were steadfast that pulling out of the project is the only way out . this is  despite the stance taken by idbi and mseb that authorisation for termination  given to mr cline and mr mcgregor was not called for . international bankers  pointed out that they will now have to look at the issue of charges and  protection for their loans in the event of the power project being scrapped  in its present form . the points of contention are : a ) that phase - i of dpc is  backed by a sovereign guarantee b ) phase - ii is not and c ) to the extent that  phase - ii is covered by assets , cancellation of phase - ii may see all assets  *  even those under phase - i  * getting attached . therefore , an examination on the  segregation of assets under phase - i and phase - ii is now warranted .  pti adds : in a significant move , dpc board has empowered its management to  sever power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could inflict a financial  liability of about rs 2840 crore on the centre . a decision to authorise dpc  president neil mcgregor to issue a termination notice to mseb for sale of  power was taken by the board at its meeting on wednesday .  the indian express , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron : dabhol chief gets powers to end deal with the mseb  the board of dabhol power company , a subsidiary of houston - based enron corp ,  has decided to warn the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) that it  intends to pull the plug on its guhagar - based project . in a board meeting held  in london on wednesday , the board decided to authorise dpc president and ceo  neil mcgregor and enron india  , s managing director k wade cline to serve a   +  + preliminary  ,  , termination notice for sale of power to the mseb within the  next four weeks . the dabhol project has been mired in disputes since mseb  began missing payments last year . mseb owes dabhol power $ 48 million for  power delivered in december and january . the payment ran into a dispute after  mseb slapped penalty notices of rs 401 crore on dpc for its failure to supply  power within three hours of the demand being placed . but mseb has paid $ 24  million for february . and a payment of $ 31 million was made for march on  thursday .  the $ 3 billion dabhol project is the largest foreign investment made in india  to date . issuing the preliminary termination notice could enable dabhol to  suspend deliveries as it negotiates payment disputes . while a preliminary  termination notice is the first of three steps that could potentially lead to  the abandonment of the project by enron , analysts have described the decision  as a  +  + procedural  ,  , move consistent with dpc  , s negotiating strategy to  recover overdue payments from the mseb .  after the company issues the preliminary termination notice , step two would  be an official termination notice , and step three would be a notice that the  company is surrendering control of the project . if the project is terminated ,  the government of india will have to take a hit of $ 300 million besides  paying bills of rs 1 , 500 crore for the next one year to enron as penalty .   +  + our ( centre  , s ) liability , if dabhol power project is terminated , would be  one year  , s electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million ,  ,  , power  secretary a k basu said .  +  + contractually , the centre will have to pay one year  ,  s electricity bill , totalling at present prices about rs 1 , 400 - 1 , 500 crore ,  and take over dpc  , s debt , which stands at around $ 300 million , if the project  was terminated ,  ,  , basu said in delhi . dabhol power is in the process of  completing the second phase of the 2 , 184 - megawatt power - plant project , which  is 95 per cent through .  while the international lenders to the project are pressurising the company  to get out of the project , indian lenders , led by idbi , are asking the  company to reconsider its decision on its termination notice . during the  meeting in london , mseb which holds a 15 per cent stake in the project , had  strongly opposed dpc  , s move to authorise cline and mcgregor to issue notices  for termination .  mseb chairman vinay bansal and technical director prem paunikar  * both  directors on the dpc board  * and the state principal secretary ( energy ) vm  lal , an invitee to the board , raised the issue at the board meeting in  london . mseb claimed that dpc was needlessly  +  + threatening  ,  , to issue various  arbitration notices and thereby interpreting the clauses of ppa in  isolation . in recent weeks , dabhol has raised the stakes in its spat with the  mseb , delivering a notice of political force majeure to maharashtra  * a step  typically invoked to dissolve a contract in case of an emergency like a war ,  coup , or a similar radical political event . in this case , dpc  , s move was  viewed as a threat to stop providing electricity . dpc has come under fire  because of the relatively high cost of its power . critics object to the  company charging rs 7 . 1 a kilowatt - hour for its power , compared with around  rs 1 . 5 a kilowatt - hour charged by other suppliers .  the hindu , friday , april 27 , 2001  offer of renegotiation ' too late ' : enron , by mahesh vijapurkar  mumbai , april 26 . the enron - sponsored dabhol power company , which last night  authorised its local management to issue a notice of termination of its power  purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state electricity board , has  decided to keep a stiff upper lip . this , in turn , has stoked speculation that  the switching off of power from its phase i plant was imminent , while in  reality , a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within the ppa .  as one source familiar with the ppa told the hindu , ` ` it is not sudden death  of the project ' ' and in all probability , the dpc , vexed with the  developments , including sharp and pointed observations by the godbole  committee , has chosen to only arm itself with a serious option . ` ` this would  only eventually come into effect . it is not an overnight operation and a lot  of legal work is involved ' ' . apparently , the dpc intends to do some  arm - twisting .  at the board of directors meeting in london , which maharashtra was initially  disinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contentions  on the project , the dpc squarely told the mseb nominees on the board that the  offer of renegotiation had come rather ` ` too late ' ' . it also said it did not  see any room for optimism about the outcome . it did not , however , rule out  the option of talks , thus underscoring the possibility that the decision to  authorise termination was a new weapon .  the maharashtra chief minister , mr . vilasrao deshmukh , had hoped that dpc  would not take any ` ` harsh step ' ' which would cause lot of damage to the  interests of both the independent power producer and the government and today  he expressed his dismay . in fact , the mandate of the team that went , on the  strength of its stake in the dpc , was to put across the idea that negotiation  was the requirement and not confrontation .  echo in ls  the enron issue also echoed in the lok sabha today where the power minister ,  mr . suresh prabhu , said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre  rs . 2 , 840 crores , whose liability in the project agreement was limited . the  centre ' s liability in case of termination is one year ' s electricity bill and  a termination fee of $ 300 million .  blow to fis  the termination could prove to be a serious blow to the indian financial  institutions ( fis ) which , under the leadership of the idbi , were trying to  convince the other lenders of the project against the notice . the exposure of  indian fis in the project is understood to be not covered by any guarantee  either of the centre or the state .  the times of india , friday , 27 april 2001  enron ready to pull out , but lenders say wait  the dabhol power company board , which met on wednesday in london , authorised  the company management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state  electricity board . the company , however , may not pull out of the project yet ,  considering its lenders , who met on monday , opposed such a move and favoured  renegotiations . sources present during both the meetings said that though  foreign lenders supported enron on the termination issue , domestic financial  institutions , led by the industrial development bank of india , prevailed over  the deliberations to oppose any such drastic move . enron needs the lenders '  consent to file a pre - termination notice for pulling out from the project .  the decision to empower dpc chief wade cline to issue a termination notice  was taken with six votes in favour against a single idbi vote against such a  move .  another significant development during the entire proceedings was that the  financial institutions made it clear that further funding of phase ii of the  project will depend on the government of india assuring payment mechanisms .  institutions are yet to disburse about 30 per cent of the sanctioned package ,  which is crucial for completing the phase ii expansion project . ` ` the board  has given powers to wade cline to issue a pre - termination notice . but the  meeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to terminate the  project but to initiate serious re - negotiation proceedings , ' ' said mseb  chairman vinay bansal , who attended the board meeting . ` ` mseb presented their  views to the board members and it was understood by enron which also included  the rs 401 crore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration proceedings .  ` ` we have also made it clear that the tariff structure of enron is quite high  and a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable , "" bansal added .  ` ` they cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our  exposure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any  plans in that direction , ' ' said a top banker who was present during the  lenders ' meet . ` ` there is a general consensus that the project must be  completed and the proposal to terminate the ppa should be kept in abeyance , ' '  he added . the global arrangers for the dpc include anz investment bank ,  credit suisse first boston , abn - amro , citibank and the state bank of india ,  where all these parties conducted separate meetings with the company  officials . however , some bankers said the company can file a termination  notice even if one lender with a minimum 5 per cent exposure on the project  favours such proceedings .  meanwhile , in a clear reversal of roles , maharashtra chief minister vilasrao  deshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the ppa .  ` ` we will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since that  would be bad news for all of us , including dpc , ' ' deshmukh said . deshmukh was  echoing union power minister suresh prabhu ' s sentiments , who said that the  government wanted an amicable settlement of the payment row . he , however ,  added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investments , and  dismissed warnings by analysts that winding up the $ 2 . 9 billion project would  be a blow to india ' s efforts to woo foreign investors .  the dpc has already slapped one conciliation notice on the centre and three  arbitration notices on the state government over non - payment of dues  amounting to rs 213 crore and interest towards the bills due for december  2000 and january 2001 . meanwhile , mseb officials said in mumbai that the  march bills amounting to rs 134 crore was paid on thursday as protest  payment , despite the dispute over the amount .  when asked on the future course of action , bansal said it was up to the dpc .  the hindu businessline , friday , april 27 , 2001  dpc board authorises md to issue ppa termination notice  the board of directors of dabhol power company ( dpc ) has authorised the  managing director , mr neil mcgregor , to issue the notice of intent to  terminate its power purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state  electricity board ( mseb ) ` ` at an appropriate time ' ' . the decision was taken  at a board meeting held in london yesterday . ` ` while mseb , which is an  ` interested party ' , was not allowed to vote , it made a presentation  clarifying its stand on the matter , ' ' a senior state government official  said .  the resolution to authorise the management to issue the termination notice  was carried by six votes to one . idbi voted against the decision , the  official said . the serving of the preliminary termination notice will lead to  a six - month ` ` suspension period ' ' . according to clause 17 . 8 of the  termination procedure , of the ppa : ` ` following the giving of a preliminary  termination notice , the parties shall consult for a period of six months ( or  such longer period as they may agree ) as to what step shall be taken with a  view to mitigating the consequences of the relevant event having regard to  all the circumstances . . . ' '  idbi and state bank of india , the principal indian lenders , had earlier  persuaded the overseas lenders to hold their consent to the termination  notice for some more time . at least one lender has to consent for the company  to serve termination notice . it is understood that overseas lenders are in  favour of termination of the project and are prepared to consent . however ,  domestic lenders are worried about the security of their advances if the ppa  is abandoned mid - way .  according to institutional sources , indian lenders are trying to get all the  parties concerned to thrash out outstanding issues . the maharashtra and  central governments too are in favour of a conciliation . mr vilasrao  deshmukh , chief minister of maharashtra , yesterday went on record that the  state did not want the project terminated . mr yashwant sinha , union finance  minister , is also understood to be of the same opinion . ` ` the dpc will now  have to decide what is the ` appropriate time ' to serve the notice , ' ' the  official said . mseb pays rs 134 crore : meanwhile , mseb has paid dpc rs 134  crore towards its march 2001 bill . mseb officials confirmed that the bill was  paid ` in protest ' ' today morning . ` ` they ( dpc ) had billed us for an amount of  rs 146 crore . we do not agree with some of the items included , ' ' a senior  mseb official said .  the pioneer , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron testing maharashtra ' s nerves , t n raghunatha  dabhol power company ( dpc ) has begun to put fresh pressure on the maharashtra  state electricity board ( mseb ) , the maharashtra state government and the  centre for an early resolution to the prolonged dispute between them , if the  dpc board of directors ' decision to authorise its managing director to serve  a contract termination notice to the mseb is any indication .  the dpc board , in its meeting in london on wednesday , empowered the company  management to sever its power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could  inflict a financial liability of rs 2 , 840 crore on the centre . the decision  to authorise the dpc management to issue a termination notice to mseb was  taken by a vote of six to one after the maharasthra government  representatives were prevented from voting on the ground of "" interested  party "" .  when contacted , the company ' s mumbai - based spokesperson , mr jimmy mogal ,  declined to comment on the reports about the decision taken by the dpc board .  "" we have nothing to say on the reports emanating from london . we will express  our views after a few days , "" he said . however , maharashtra chief minister  vilasrao deshmukh on thursday termed the dpc board ' s decision as  "" unfortunate "" . "" we have already requested the company not to take any harsh  decision "" , mr deshmukh said in mumbai .  official sources in the state energy ministry interpreted the dpc board ' s  decision as a pressure tactic employed by the enron subsidiary to force the  mseb to clear the pending power bills without any further delay . through its  tough posture , the dpc wants to make its position stronger before it can  formally agree for re - negotiations with the mseb , the centre and the state  government for cutting the price of power supplied by it to the state  electricity board . the sources said that the dpc ' s reported decision to  authorise its managing director to stop electricity supply to the mseb did  not mean that the enron subsidiary would actually go ahead with the scrapping  of the power contract with the mseb .  "" if anything , the dpc ' s reported decision is to mount additional pressure on  the mseb for clearance of pending power bills and put itself in a stronger  position in settling its dispute with the mseb . as part of its plan to arm  itself with powers to break a contract in case situation goes beyond its  control , the dpc had recently served a political force majeure to the mseb ,  the centre and the state government , "" the sources said . not surprisingly , the  dpc ' s london decision comes on the heels of the maharashtra government ' s  decision to set up a high - level committee , comprising representatives of the  mseb , the centre and the state government to re - negotiate with the enron ' s  subsidiary company for reducing the cost of power supplied to the state  electricity board . meanwhile , amidst the threat of a possible termination  notice hanging on its head , the mseb on thursday made a "" protest payment "" of  the rs 134 crore disputed amount towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to dpc .  riday , april 27  the telegraph , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron signal to switch off dabhol power  enron today took the first decisive step out of the controversy - ridden dabhol  power company when it won an authorisation from the company  , s board to stop  sale of power to maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) .  the meeting of the company , of which the houston - based energy giant holds 65  per cent and the mseb 15 per cent , was attended by state energy secretary v m  lal and mseb technical director p paunikar and it came days after its lenders  discussed payment problems and a possible termination . the centre  , s liability ,  if enron decides to snap the agreement , will be a year  , s power bill and a  termination fee of $ 300 million . however , the company will have to wait for  six months from the day it serves the notice before it pulls the plug . the  centre shrugged off the move , saying there would not be any adverse effect on  foreign investment in power if enron walks out .  & we do not see fdi inflows  into the power sector being hit ,  8 power minister suresh prabhu said . mseb  officials said the ball is now in the court of dpc , which said its corporate  policy did not allow it to comment on proceedings at board meetings . the  decision coincided with a rs 134 - crore  + protest payment  , by the cash - strapped  power board as part of the march bill worth rs 146 . 64 crore .  there was speculation that mseb coughed up the amount to cool frayed tempers  at enron  , s hub in houston , and because it was rattled by the sudden turn of  events in the past few days during which the dispute had come to a head . mseb  officials brushed away the allusions , saying the cheque was ready on  wednesday but could not be handed over to dpc because of the state - wide  bandh .  & we have a disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore , which will be taken up  at the dispute - resolution forum ,  8 a board official said . last week , dpc told  the state government and mseb it would no longer accept protest payments in a  move to fortify its legal position .  mseb officials say bechtel and general electric , the other partners who hold  around 20 per cent in dpc , are willing to go along with enron corp in  terminating the deal but financial institutions such as idbi are not game  because it puts their loans at risk . investments made by indian institutions  are not covered under the centre  , s and state  , s counter - guarantees , unlike  those made by international lenders . maharashtra chief minister vilasrao  deshmukh called enron  , s decision unfortunate .  & we had told state government  officials attending the enron board meeting to stop the company from winding  up its operations in the state as it will harm both parties .  8  the statesman , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron threatens to pull out  the enron crisis deepened with the board of directors of the dabhol power  company deciding to authorise the managing director , mr k wade cline , to  serve a notice of termination on the contract for the first phase of the $ 2 . 9  billion power project . the decision , which could lead to the cessation of  dabhol  , s power supply to the state , was taken at the meeting held yesterday  in london according to reports quoting the chairman of the maharashtra state  electricity board , mr vinay bansal .  while dpc officials refuse to comment on anything , it is learnt that mseb was  itself prepared to serve a legal notice of termination just two days before  the meeting . mseb was said to have been dissuaded by the nationalist congress  party president , mr sharad pawar , and union power minister mr suresh prabhu ,  who had talks in new delhi with the maharashtra chief minister , mr vilasrao  deshmukh , and an mseb delegation last monday .  the state government has been served two arbitration notices while the centre  is ready to go for conciliation with the dpc for failing to honour its  counter - guarantee . further , the dpc has already slapped a notice of political  force majeure which protects itself against undeserved claims in the event of  exigencies that force it to take an extreme step . the union power minister , mr  suresh prabhu , contended in delhi that since dpc contributed only 0 . 7 per  cent of the total energy output of the country , its termination would not  have such a phenomenal impact on the power situation .  however , if terminations proceedings go through , enron corp , a 65 per cent  share - holder in the dabhol power company , would stand to net a hefty amount  in damages . the union power secretary has been quoted as saying that  termination of the dpc would cost the centre rs 1 , 800 crore , which is the  total of one years  , electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million .  according to an energy analyst , mr pradyumna kaul , the total liability would  not cross rs 350 crore . however mr prabhu said in the lok sabha today that  the that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs 2 , 840 crore . it  is learnt that on 20 april , mr deshmukh had given the go - ahead to the mseb to  prepare a legal notice to be issued to enron during the meeting of the dpc  , s  board of directors on wednesday . at the meeting , the energy minister ,  padamsinh patil , energy secretary , mr vinay mohan lal and mseb chairman mr  vinay bansal , were also present . the notice was prepared over the past weekend  and taken by the delegation when they called on mr prabhu on 24 april .  however , the politicians convinced them that enron would not get tough , given  its huge stake in the project , and that such a notice would not be necessary .  the meeting thus ended with the decision to renegotiate the power tariff ,  with enron  , s consent .  among those present at the london meeting were mr lal , mr bansal and mseb  technical director , mr p paunikar , in their capacity as directors . however ,  they abstained from voting since they were deemed an interested party . the  only vote to go against the decision was that of the idbi which is also  represented on the board , it is learnt . the chief minister , mr vilasrao  deshmukh , said the state was not in favour of terminating the project . this  could mean that the latest manoeuvre to arm - twist the indian authorities  could achieve its immediate target of getting the arrears accumulated over  the past three months cleared . the mseb owes enron rs 146 . 64 crore for march  2001 and rs 229 crore for december 2000 and january 2001 . the centre today put  up a brave face on enron  , s decision saying there would not be any adverse  effect on foreign investment in power sector in the country , pti reported  from new delhi .   & there will be no adverse impact as a result of any action by any domestic or  foreign company . as far as we are concerned there will be no adverse impact  on fdi in power sector ,  8 power minister suresh prabhu told reporters when  asked about dpc  , s decision to authorise management to issue a termination  notice to mseb . emphasising that there would be no fallout of such decision ,  prabhu said after the meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs   & we are expecting cooperation from many scandinavian countries as well as  european nations in the power sector .  & in fact not only the power minister but  also the prime minister of norway was here to inaugurate a seminar on power  and he promised lot of cooperation in the sector .  8  mid day  ' dpc may not wind up '  maharashtra chief secretary v ranganathan has said that though neil mcgregor ,  managing director of the dabhol power corporation ( dpc ) , has been given  complete powers with regard to dpc ' s operations in the state , including the  authority to wind up operations , it does not necessarily mean that mcgregor  will issue such a termination notice . mcgregor was given the powers at a  meeting of the dpc board in london on wednesday . ranganathan said that state  officials , including maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) chairman  vinay bansal and power secretary v m lal , have reported back to him about the  meeting in london .  with regard to the state ' s failure to pay enron , ranganathan said , "" bills  are prepared as per the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) and dpc owes some  money to us . our people informed enron officials about this . . in fact , there  was no reason to give powers to the md to slap a termination notice . "" in the  london meeting , mseb and industrial development bank of india ( idbi )  representatives insisted that the dpc must pay rs 411 crore since it could  not supply power whenever needed .  chief minister vilasrao deshmukh has already termed as unfortunate the  decision of the board of the enron - promoted dpc to give mcgregor powers to  wind up operations . deshmukh added , "" we have already requested enron not to  take any harsh decision . "" deshmukh had earlier said , "" we have directed state  government officials attending the dpc board meeting to desist the energy  company from winding up operations in the state , as it would be harmful to  both of us . ""  enron officials are keeping mum on the issue . mcgregor said , "" i am not going  to give any comment . ""  mid day , april 27 , 2001  enron offers ' no comment ' on renegotiation , h s rao  a crucial meeting of the board of directors of the dabhol power company  ( dpc ) , promoted by the us energy major enron , was held here yesterday  apparently to discuss fate of its $ 900 - million power project in maharashtra ,  but there was no official word on the indian and state governments ' decision  to renegotiate the contract .  an enron spokesman declined to divulge what transpired at the meeting , saying  the issues discussed at the meeting were ' confidential ' . "" we have not  received any direct communication . unless we get it and evaluate the details ,  we have no comments to make , "" the spokesman said when asked about the  proposed decision on re - negotiation of the project in which the maharashtra  state electricity board ( mseb ) has 15 per cent stake .  asked whether the board had taken a decision on empowering dpc managing  director neil mcgregor to wind up its operations in india , the spokesman said  he had nothing to say on them . enron has reportedly authorised mcgregor to  look at various options including selling the company ' s stake in dpc .  maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said in mumbai that the state  government would pay up the undisputed dues to the company . he said the  maharashtra government "" is not in favour of terminating the 2184 - mw project ,  but wanted an amicable solution to the imbroglio . ""  mid day , friday , april 27 , 2001 ,  committee to renegotiate enron deal  a committee to renegotiate the power purchase agreement with the dabhol power  company will be appointed by this evening , chief minister vilasrao deshmukh  said today . addressing media persons after his meeting with the noted social  reformer anna hazare at his official residence varsha , deshmukh said the  committee would be formed by this evening or by tomorrow , at the most . he  termed as unfortunate the enron board decision empowering dpc chief neil  mcgregor to serve a preliminary termination notice on the maharashtra state  electricity board and said the state was willing to negotiate the issue with  power company .  "" renegotiations will be held as per the suggestions made by the godbole  committee and the center will also depute its representative on the  renegotiating committee . we don ' t want to take any hasty decision , "" deshmukh  saidhe pointed that the only bone of contention with the dpc had been its  expensive tariff and hoped that the issue would be resolved amicably . when  pointed that the enron board had taken a decision to serve the notice despite  state  9 s willingness to appoint a renegotiating committee , chief minister  said it was unfortunate .  earlier , in his meeting with hazare , deshmukh promised to make necessary  amendments to the right to information law recently passed by the state so  that the information was easily accessed by the common people . he also gave a  patient hearing to hazare on his complaints of corruption in various state  departments and promised action against guilty after a thorough inquiry  within three months .  afternoon , april 27 , 2001  ' enron ' s on ! '  state govt . to renegotiate dabhol power project , by hubert vaz  the us power giant , enron power corporation ' s willingness to wrap up the  dabhol power project and leave the shores may not actually materialise ,  though the dabhol power company chief , mr . wade cline , has been authorised to  do so , since the lenders for the project would have a decisive say in the  matter .  disclosing this , chief minister vilasrao deshmukh confirmed this morning that  the state government would churn out a compromise formula by which the power  project at dabhol could be continued , and at the same time enron did not feel  slighted . "" enron has not yet conveyed to us about this decision . we are  waiting for their letter , "" he said . when asked what sort of compromise the  state government plans to forge , mr . deshmukh said , "" let our officers come  back . after that we will decide a future course of action . but we are  definitely going in for renegotiation of the project . it is very difficult to  predict the outcome of enron ' s decision but as of now the project is still  on . "" when asked whether the project could be moved to another state , if wound  up from maharashtra , mr . deshmukh said , that was not possible as per the  terms of the agreement between the us company and the state government .  however , it was difficult for the project to move out of the state itself , he  indicated . he also confirmed that both parties would face considerable losses  if the project was terminated .  the board of directors of the dabhol power company , which met in london on  wednesday , decided to put an end to all controversies surrounding the project  once and for all by empowering the dpc chief to terminate the project , if he  deemed it fit . however , this decision , as of now , does not necessarily  indicate the death knell for the project . the enron project , which had been  riddled with controversies right from its inception , had been a pretext for  the political parties in the state to drag each other on the mat from time to  time . the previous sena - bjp government , which had been out to terminate the  project , however , chose to continue with it following renegotiations with  enron ' s top visiting officials like ms . rebecca mark . and , the democratic  front government inherited the controversial project when the governments  changed hands a year and a half ago .  meanwhile , state energy minister dr . padamsinh patil , when contacted at the  osmanabad circuit house , said the state government and the central government  have decided to appoint a joint committee to renegotiate the project with  enron . "" it is not easy for them to walk out of the project just like that .  they will have to go in for litigation and this would prove costly for both  sides , "" he said . in case the project is terminated , the government can still  manage the power needs of the state , though it would be a bit tough job , he  added ."

"" he noted that the only reason they haven ' t yet is that "" they were too stupid to ring - fence the parent "" and that "" their two biggest equity holders were screaming not to do it . ""  he added that the davis / socal mou is dead and that all the "" plan b ' s "" are "" speculative "" at best . he also thought that socal was being "" naive if they thought they would get a better deal from the legislature than from the bankruptcy court . ""  2 . bond issuance - $ 12 b not enough  angelides conceded that a $ 12 b bond issue would not be enough to buy power for the summer and that the true costs would probably be $ 18 - 24 b . the only reason they didn ' t issue more is that angelides felt that "" $ 12 b was all the market could handle . "" the current game plan for bonds assumes an average peak price for power of $ 400 / mwh , which angelides said explains the difference between his estimates and the higher estimates from state comptroller ' s kathleen connell ' s office .  3 . new generator construction  anglelides was explicit that the california public power authority ( authorized by the legislature last week ) will "" build plants and not stop until we [ california ] has a 10 - 15 % capacity cushion above expected demand . angelides expects the state to be "" 5 - 10 % short on power all summer .

1386,"Subject: industry giants can ' t match this opportunity  another ground breaking news alert from rlyc .  the potential stored - value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately 150 million people , of which only about 12 million now maintain active stored - value debit card accounts .  one company is quickly entering a $ 2 trillion market space with a proposed portfolio of product and service offerings that even the largest multi - national corporations in its industry may have a hard time matching . in just a few months , this company has begun adding and developing innovative new products and targeting acquisitions that could help it reach millions of new long - term customers that could generate tremendous re - occurring revenues for many years to come .  although you have probably never heard of this company , you may soon hear of it even if you don ' t continue reading this message . that ' s because it is making a major push to put its products in the hands of a half million people in the u . s . within the next year .  an upstart company to make a real impact in a two trillion dollar industry  in reality , this company ' s lack of early recognition could be a major plus for you . since the overwhelming majority of investors and institutions don ' t know this company or what they plan to accomplish , their stock is trading at rock bottom prices . but , if they do accomplish even a small part of what they have set out to do over the coming months and years , this company could become a significant player in its trillion dollar industry and its stock reflect its accomplishments .  the company that we ' ll introduce you to today is ( relay capital corp . pink sheets : rlyc ) . rlyc , which recently went public , is a multi - faceted financial services company that focuses primarily on the stored value card market . rlyc ' s present product and service offerings include pre - paid stored - value cards , reward cards , employee payroll cards , gift , retail and affinity group cards , travel cards and funds transfer cards . these services are aimed at a significant market both domestically and internationally .  just because a company is in a large and growing industry doesn ' t necessarily ensure that it will be a winner . in order to be successful , that company also needs to be truly innovative , have very strong partners , be able to reach vast customer bases and have a management team capable of putting it all together and turning its goals into reality . rlyc appears to be that company .  below we ' ll discuss this substantial potential market rlyc is after and what sets rlyc apart from the competition .  the potential stored - value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately 150 million people , of which only about 12 million now maintain active stored - value debit card accounts .  stored - value cards have the potential to help the 50 million adults and their families who have been excluded from the e - commerce revolution because they do not have access to credit or banking facilities . the implications reverberate across industry segments . estimates suggest stored - value transactions could exceed $ 2 trillion in just a few years .  rlyc ' s focus is on providing stored - value cards to the un - banked and under - banked . these terms refer to consumers that that do not have a bank account , debit card . the size of that group is staggering that ' s about one - third of the nation ' s work force !  rlyc capitalizes on the dilemma these consumers face by providing stored - value card programs that make it easy , fast and secure for people and businesses to buy all manners of goods and services using stored - value cards as well as for the un - banked and under - banked to be paid their salaries via the same cards .  but that ' s not all . the benefits relay will offer on its stored value cards as well as other financial services will also be of great benefit to those who already have banking relationships . in this segment , relay plans to offer more services with greater convenience for less cost to the consumer . who wouldn ' t want that ? the payroll market is another enormous market for rlyc  for the under - and un - banked , collecting their pay , cashing payroll checks and then paying bills with those funds can be extremely complicated and time consuming . rlyc ' s stored - value pay transfer card program presents a very effective and innovative solution for this problem .  rlyc ' s pay transfer card program can lower costs to employers to process payroll for the banked and the un - banked alike ! lower costs to cardholders to potentially transfer cash between u . s . cards , cards in foreign countries , and services bought through the cards , improved employee retention , improved customer retention will all be available thanks to rlyc . various programs will make life much easier for cardholders using the system , while also providing the convenience and flexibility of either visa or mastercard purchasing power or 24 hour access to their money through atms .  rlyc signs loi with national staffing company to use its pay transfer cards  earlier this year , rlyc signed a binding letter of intent to provide a pay transfer card program for asgard global resources llc ( click to go to their site ) , a leader in providing technical , craft and administrative staffing services to businesses , industry and government through locations in houston , dallas , long island , orlando , phoenix and southern california all areas with huge un - and under - banked populations .  the potential market for this service is really big . it includes large employers , companies that process payroll and financial institutions that provide banking and payroll services to commercial customers .  this system will simplify payments to widely dispersed employees and contractors while dramatically decreasing payroll distribution by offering a cost effective alternative to printing , cutting , and mailing paper payroll checks . it also helps to reduce a great deal of paper processing of checks and pay , eliminate lost checks , stop payments and minimize fraud . but best of all , this should help to significantly boost rlyc ' s revenues .  $ 150 billion sent worldwide by relatives to home countries  mexicans in u . s . send $ 16 . 3 billion a year back to mexico  with $ 150 billion being transferred internationally each year , remittances are a really big business . in times past , people wanting to send money to relatives back in their home countries had few choices . many times their only choice was an expensive proposition like western union . more recently , more and more people have resorted to purchasing and mailing money orders in order to try to cut down on the cost of sending remittances .  the problems with traditional money transfer methods  with wire services , there are any number of inherent problems when trying to send money to relatives overseas . first , wiring funds across borders can be expensive . this can make it very cost - prohibitive to send smaller amounts of cash and often means that relatives must wait longer to receive their remittances because the sender has to save up until the amount is large enough to warrant the cost associated with the wire service . next there is the problem of logistics . both the sender and the recipient must be able to easily reach a storefront that offers the same wire company ' s services . even if they both are able to do this , the recipient may have to make multiple trips to the wire service office to check to see if their funds have cleared yet and can be released to them . lastly , the sender and the recipient are subjected to varying service fees depending on which wire service they choose . these fees can be very high and can significantly cut into the amount of money the recipient ultimately receives . so , even though using a wire service may be a fairly fast way to transfer money , it can be very expensive and logistically difficult to use .  with money orders there is always the problem of mail service . although in america we have grown accustomed to relatively quick and reliable mail service , this is not always the case in foreign countries . this is especially true in underdeveloped nations , where most remittances are sent . a letter containing a remittance that a family is depending on to provide much needed food and shelter could take many days or even weeks to arrive . and , there is always the chance that it will never arrive at its destination at all , meaning that the sender ' s family could go hungry or end up on the streets .  what is the best way to send remittances ?  by far the most convenient , fast , safe and ultimately cost efficient method to send remittances is through a stored - value card . with this type of service , a person can easily activate a card and then just deposit funds into the account ( onto the card ) via loading station , telephone or the internet for easy use by relatives in his or her home country .  the process is extremely easy and cost - effective . funds can be added to the card ' s account at an ever increasing number of convenient locations . the family member overseas can then draw down on those funds by presenting a card from that account to make purchases or they can use the card to withdraw cash from atms . it could not be any simpler .  rlyc has already begun filling orders  in june of this year , rlyc announced that it had received its first order for 2 , 000 pin - based stored value cards . the company stated that its growth estimates call for approximately 2 , 000 new stored - value cards being put into circulation each month . this could result in exponential revenue growth as new customers are added and its customers take advantage of its other financial services . moreover , though other programs it is working on , it could have one half million cards in the market within the next 18 months .  rlyc plans to expand its services through partner companies and one - stop financial centers  rlyc expects to fuel exponential growth of recurring revenue from individual card usage , monthly fees , as well as other activities occurring at its loading centers or the virtual financial centers it is planning . loading centers are retail locations , such as convenience stores , check cashing facilities or other types of retail facilities serving to dispense or receive cash facilitating transactions for the debit card consumer . rlyc has already established strategic relationships with leading card processors , vendors and distributors , and is in program development with key partners that may bring over 100 , 000 retail locations and a host of great opportunities to dramatically increase its brand recognition .  rlyc plans a host of new financial products and service offerings  some of the products and services rlyc plans to be launching in the coming months include commercial , auto and sba loans , mortgages , all types of affinity group ( loyalty / rewards ) cards , pharmacy discount cards , certificates of deposit ( cd ' s ) , health savings accounts and health and life insurance . rylc is expanding extremely rapidly and at this pace , should gain a whole lot of exposure to the investment community f - a - s - t ! ! !  rlyc plans to grow through joint ventures and acquisitions  through a well - planned strategy to partner with major players in the financial services industry and through key acquisitions of complimentary companies , rlyc plans to fuel its growth . it has begun identifying and will negotiate business joint ventures , acquisitions and partnerships within the stored value card industry .  rlyc is positioned to offer expanded payroll products as well as define a niche market for its private label stored value solutions . with corporate network ' s assistance , it expects to add new and expansive products linked to its card platform and provide its customers with a growing range of superior products and increased customer loyalty .  rlyc plans to enter the emerging high growth health savings account ( hsa ) market  rlyc has entered into an agreement in principle with mydaily corp . , an employee benefit and financial services company , to provide health saving account ( hsa ) stored value debit cards that will enable employees to easily pay routine medical bills with pre - tax dollars .  health savings accounts ( hsa ) are tax - sheltered savings accounts similar to an ira , but earmarked for medical expenses and are part of a high deductible insurance plan . deposits are 100 % tax - deductible for the self - employed and for employees of companies that offer an hsa .  this could be an enormous new market for rlyc  it is estimated that all millions of non - elderly americans will soon have access to a health savings account , creating a market of unprecedented potential . in fact , due to the rising costs of employer - sponsored health plans , it is also estimated that one in every two major employers in the united states is considering consumer directed health plans and hsa for their employees .  experienced stored value card and financial services industry executive named ceo of relay capital corp .  e . reese bogle iii , experienced financial services and stored value card industry executive , has been named relay ' s . most recently he was one of the founders , and served as executive vice president and chief operating officer of interstate net bank ( www . isnbank . com ) , establishing it as a visa principal member .  prior to this , mr . bogle , was vp of e * trade bank ' s corporate development and strategic alliances group and president of telebanc insurance services , inc . he also served as vp and marketing director of premium bank , and held a variety of managerial and marketing positions at leading financial services companies .  relay will be adding real depth experience to its management team  the next step is to bring a well qualified management team to relay capital said mr . bogle . once the team is onboard , we intend to build relay capital into a diversified financial services provider that , in addition to looking for exponential growth of recurring revenue generated from individual stored card usage , as well as other financial service activities occurring at our card loading centers or its virtual financial centers , we potentially plan to provide : commercial loans , auto loans , sba loans , mortgages , certificates of deposit ( cd ' s ) , health benefits ( dental , vision ) , life insurance benefits , pharmacy drug discounts , loyalty and reward programs , and shopping discount programs .  with innovative products and services targeted to trillion dollar market ; a host of powerful partners ; key acquisitions in the works ; orders already coming in ; and a top - notch management team to bring it all together , rlyc seems to be headed for sunny skies .  this company will not remain below the radar screens of wall street ' s mover shakers or even the average investor for much longer . . . if you are on the lookout for companies that have what it takes to experience rapid growth , but are still trading at rock bottom prices , you should call your financial advisor today about relay capital corp .

4745,"Subject: re : d - g energy  karla ,  the wording you have below sounds reasonable as we would only use the code  for internal valuation purposes .  i also checked with vince regarding the issues we discussed by phone  yesterday . he would like to specify a 2 day response time for the software  support . also , he would like to specify that the payment schedule be : 50 %  at time of initial contract and 50 % at the time when the software is  released . this would give them an incentive to release the software before  the full year is over if they want to accelerate the payment .  thanks again for all the help ,  stinson  from : karla feldman on 09 / 06 / 2000 10 : 30 am  to : stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : d - g energy  stinson ,  while trying to put together the agreements for d - g energy , i have an  additional question :  i need to know exactly what yall plan to do with the source code once you  have it after the initial one year period is up ? there are still limitations  as to what you can do with it , so i will need to know so we can try to revise  the contract so that you will be legal .  for example , in the language regarding release of the source code from  escrow , it states that once you have the source code , you just have the  "" right to use , copy and modify the source code , solely for our internal  purposes in connection with support , maintenance and operation of the  software "" .  do yall plan to reverse engineer , decompile , etc ? do you plan on using any  of their code to create our own product ? if so - i think these are going to  be a problem . the latter would be an infringement issue , unless we were to  contract to do so .  please let me know more details of your plan so i can see how we need to  proceed in this area .  thanks ,  karla  x 67554"

"" this new market standard should put into place the necessary market  improvements more quickly and at a reduced cost than if we were to implement a  customized market system for new england , "" said william w . berry , chairman and  acting ceo of iso new england . "" now is the time to stop the experimentation .  ultimately , we hope the standard market design will serve as the benchmark for  wholesale electricity marketplaces across the country , if not around the  world . ""  "" pjm is very excited to further standardize a design for a competitive  wholesale  electricity market , "" said phillip g . harris , chairman and ceo of pjm . "" along  with the progress in the implementation of the pjm west concept , this  initiative  will provide an even broader standardized market design . ""  this approach should further expedite the elimination of trading barriers  across  different markets and promote ferc ' s goal of creating a seamless marketplace .  "" we intend to continue to work with the new york iso on issues of mutual  importance , "" stated mr . berry . "" this new market design , together with our  efforts to address the market "" seams "" and other coordination issues , will  eventually bring the three northeast iso markets closer together . "" iso new  england and the new york iso will continue to work together on these issues  under a joint board resolution passed on january 16 , 2001 .  "" because of our geographic location , new york is in the center of the  northeast  markets , with iso new england , pjm and imo each on one of our borders . we  support the continued elimination of barriers across northeast trading markets  to develop a more seamless marketplace where everyone will benefit , "" said  william j . museler , president and ceo of the new york independent system  operator . "" the new york iso will continue to work with our neighboring markets  to remove barriers to trading across the region and to move towards larger  regional markets . ""  this proposed market design standard will be developed jointly with  stakeholder  input . iso new england will propose the standard market design to the new  england conference of public utility commissioners and the new england power  pool in a series of meetings next week . additional meetings will be conducted  in the next few weeks . the standard market design for new england will be  subject to ferc approval .  "" standardization requires consistent and reliable technology to facilitate a  market ' s efficiency . a market that moderates price fluctuations and  encourages  investment based on an expected return is an efficient market - - and  efficiency  is the key to establishing market liquidity , "" said alain steven , ceo of alstom  esca . "" in the future , this agreement will be viewed as a catalyst in  establishing more robust electricity markets .

2812,"Subject: gas prices  vince -  1 . we can detect "" hoarding "" of pipeline capacity as an elevated basis against  the actual inflow .  2 . we can detect "" market power "" by dissociating the seller from the buyer ,  distinguishing between the physical "" cost "" in gas to run the generators and  the transmission cost in dollars , i . e . the basis .  3 . ( as you noted ) we can detect "" storage "" as the difference between inflow  and consumption .  it appears to me there are two time series needed for a straightforward model  of gas prices : flow rates at interconnects ( from telemetry ) and spot - market  prices . there is an elevated basis reflecting pipeline companies monopolizing  capacity , as well as hoarding of capacity by contracts . the dynamics of gas  prices reflect consumption demand changes due to changes in expectations for  the weather , as well as their impact on two highly strategic behaviors :  hoarding of pipeline capacity and storage of gas . we can "" calibrate "" the  price elasticity of demands for consumption and storage , and the price  elasticities of demand for transmission , as well as the extent of hoarding ,  from the two sets of numbers mentioned : flows and prices . what the basis  trader needs to understand are the incentives , and disincentives , for storage  and capacity - hoarding , in terms of the calibrated price - elasticities , and  each of these are as - if exotic call options at the consumption hub . finally ,  flows are "" explained "" by the model , and can be imputed from prices if  necessary , resulting in a purely stochastic model of the basis in terms of  the weather .  i believe the problem is quite tractable , and i would like to proceed with a  model .  clayton"

6465,"Subject: erisk interview  vince :  you may inteersted in the following interview which appeared on erisk . com last friday . were rick buy ' s comments about real options taken out of context ?  yann bonduelle leads a 25 - person team for in london  that applies decision analytics and real options theory to dilemmas ranging from  valuing a biotechnology product to deciding whether to kill off an internet financial  services business . here he talks to rob jameson about whether this "" theoretical ""  approach to risky decision - making really helps businesses in their day - to - day  balancing of risk and reward . yann holds a ph . d degree from the  engineering - economic systems department at stanford university , where he  studied how to apply engineering decision and design analysis to wider economic ,  social and business issues . he then worked as a consultant applying his decision  analysis methodologies to problems that included consumer decision making  about innovative products such as electrical vehicles , before joining the   team in 1998 where he is now a partner . he has  written widely on the application of real options , particularly in fields of life  sciences , technology , and e - business , and has a special interest in the  relationship between risk assessment , validation of risk data and financial  valuation .  how would you sum up your approach to business decision analytics ?  most of our projects are set up to help businesses that face massive uncertainties  of some kind . decision analysis helps people explore problems , and redesign  their decision - making process to increase the chance of them making the right  choices . for example , imagine a biotechnology company that has to decide  whether to put itself up for sale , enter a strategic relationship , or continue to go it  alone . each of those options will lead on to other value - enhancing or  value - destroying scenarios . we work with the client firstly to understand and  challenge the assumptions associated with their most likely business  development scenarios , and secondly to help them identify decisions that would  help protect or increase the value of their technology or company . quantifying  technical , regulatory or commercial risks can sometimes be a challenge . in  technology - intensive fields , however , we have found that managers ( often  scientists ) are quite willing to describe the main sources of risk and to assess the  probability that a risky event may or may not occur .  how does this kind of risky decision - making relate to real options valuation ?  you can ' t say what the value of an asset is until you decide what you might use it  for . this means that , to form an opinion about the value of an asset , you must  explore the most important decisions that you are likely to face and that will have  a significant impact on the value of the asset . so decision analysis helps to define  the business problem and to uncover a stream of inter - related choices that are , in  effect , "" real options "" . for example , if a company is trying to decide whether to  invest in a risky project , does it have the option to pull the plug on the investment  at an early stage if a pilot project gives a poor showing ? that "" real "" option reduces  the riskiness , and increases the potential value , of the original business plan . so  real options and decision analysis are really very close to one another . but you  don ' t have to believe in real options valuations to find decision analysis useful .  what do you mean ?  often decision analysis can help managers to identify the key risks in a strategic  decision , attach weights to these , and show clearly how they interact . for many  companies this "" risk discovery "" is the most valuable part of the exercise .  real options theory has been criticised recently for being , well , not very realistic .  is it a practical approach to valuation ?  it ' s important not to hold out unrealistic hopes for the real options approach to  valuation . but it ' s an exciting methodology , and it ' s also sometimes the only  reasonable way of tackling a very practical problem . for example , when a firm  sells an asset , the firm might have to make an independent valuation of the asset  for legal or corporate governance reasons . but in many businesses today there  are assets that simply cannot be valued in traditional ways because they are  difficult to link to cashflows . the cashflows might not exist because the business  is so novel , or they might be hidden . in some respects , a real options analysis is  much closer to reality than a traditional valuation .  how , exactly ?  the classic way of valuing a future business is to base the calculation on a single  discounted cashflow that is projected from the activity . but this doesn ' t really take  account of the way that scenarios can change , or the fact that managers can  react to situations as they unfold . i mentioned earlier the option to kill a project or  business at an early point . but the upside is that if a pilot project yields exciting  results , it might allow you to invest more quickly and reach a revenue - generating  position in a much shorter time than the original business plan allows . so to value  a future business we really need to look at the cashflows that might arise in a  number of scenarios . this is "" realistic "" in that , if the project gets the green light ,  you can bet that its managers will be taking that kind of decision on the ground all  of the time .  what ' s the most challenging part of mapping out a decision analysis tree ?  modelling the links between the variables in the decision tree - - it ' s something we  have particular strengths in . but it ' s also tricky to know when it ' s worthwhile to  add on more detail , and when it ' s better to draw back .  in a recent erisk interview , rick buy , chief risk officer of enron , said that over  the two years that enron had experimented with the real options concept , it had  found it of "" limited , but not zero , use "" . why is there a slight air of cynicism about  real options in some businesses today ?  it ' s strange that enron would profess this attitude . a few years ago , it was widely  reported to have used real option valuation to support a very profitable purchase  decision . they had apparently bought cheaply some older generators in the us  that generated electricity at a very high cost . they knew that they could mothball  them for most of the year , and switch them on only when the electricity prices  were sufficiently high . nevertheless , from a customer ' s point of view , there might  have been too much hype about the methodology . one problem in the application  of real options technology is that there are , perhaps , too many people trying to  tweak reality to conform to their "" perfect "" model . it ' s better to aim for something  pragmatic that clearly improves decisions over time . in one pharmaceutical  company we worked with recently , we worked together to improve their valuation  analyses by moving from a single discounted cash - flow methodology to one that  took into account a rather small set of business scenarios . it would have shocked  some academics and consultants , but it was an undeniable improvement on the  original approach .  why do you think financial institutions are only just picking up on your field , when  it ' s been applied in the energy industry for 15 years or more ?  it might have something to do with the relative stability of the banking world until  recently , and the relatively high margins that banking lines have enjoyed . also ,  industries such as energy and pharmaceuticals tend to have more people with an  engineering and science background . the dynamic modelling of decisions is  based on methodologies originally dreamed up to help engineers design electrical  and electronic systems . this approach is quite distinct from the black - scholes  options analyses that the banking world is familiar with : the black - scholes  approach is difficult to apply in a real options context , because everything  depends on the assumptions that you put into the black - scholes model . the real  options approach , on the other hand , is in a sense a way of modelling those  assumptions more explicitly . but banks are now adopting some of the thinking ,  particularly in terms of using decision analysis to pinpoint risks and identify  value - enhancing decisions , and in using real options methodologies to sort the  wheat from the chaff in their more speculative investments .  you mean their internet investments ?  we have recently worked with a major dutch bank that had arrived late in the  internet game , and then made a considerable number of investments . now that  even b 2 b business models have questions marks hanging over them , and many  b 2 c businesses are already under water , they wanted to work out which  investments might contain real value . in this situation , it ' s a case of ranking  priorities and helping the bank make sense of what could turn into a  decision - making chaos , rather than sophisticated valuation . it ' s not just a case of  whether an internet investment should be killed off , but the problem of whether  continued funding for it should take priority over budget demands for major it  upgrades in existing businesses , and so on . these are very practical questions  and they have to be answered somehow .  are there other areas in financial institutions that seem accessible to this  approach ?  yes , for example , we think it can help work out the value associated with various  approaches to marketing a new bank business line . at the moment , many banks  are chasing high - net - worth individuals , but it ' s not always clear which kind of  individual a particular bank should decide to pursue . the bank might have a  regional or industry advantage already in one particular area , for example , music  business people . but what is the churn rate associated with this kind of  customer ? what is the profitability associated with the customer segment ? will  the time and cost benefits of the advantages the bank has in the sector outweigh  any disadvantages ? weighing up this kind of complex problem , where one thing  leads to and depends on another , is what decision and real options analysis is  good at .  is there any way of rigorously backtesting or validating real options valuations ?  in all honesty , not really . the problem is that by the time the option is exercised ,  many of the variables surrounding it will have changed , so it ' s difficult to compare  our original analysis with how things turn out . however , the value of the analysis  comes not only from the final number ( "" the value of this asset is x "" ) but also from  providing a thorough process , an outsider ' s point of view , an understanding of the  sources of value and , in short , a bit of clearer thinking .  if real options are so important , why are they so rarely cited in communications to  shareholders and equity analysts ?  the battle is still to convince companies to use real option valuations as a  significant part of their internal analysis . even in major companies in the oil & gas ,  and pharmaceutical sectors , where the ideas have taken some root internally ,  there seems to be a lot of reluctance to use them in external communication . we  are working with analysts to understand better what they need to if we are to move  things on to the next step .  how does the riskiness of a business , in terms of the major strategic dilemmas it  faces , relate to its share value , and its capital structure ?  that ' s a big question . it ' s related to work my colleagues do on the optimal  debt - to - equity capital structure and gearing of a corporation , which in turn arises  out of the likely revenue and cost volatilities of the business . the more volatile the  business , the less gearing it can sustain , and the higher the cost of capital . our  work touches on this in the sense that exercising ( many ) specific real options can  allow a firm to change its nature , and thus also its risk profile . one classic  example is the pharmaceutical industry . a host of different kinds of companies  service that industry from "" big pharma "" companies through to smaller  biotechnology startups and run - of - the - mill contract research organisations . a  contract research organisation is often operating within a very competitive  environment with relatively few risks - - it does not invest in drug development itself  - - but also very thin margins . but in fact , a few of these companies have used the  skills and knowledge they have developed to become much more substantial and  profitable healthcare companies of various kinds . it ' s an example of a company  exercising the real options that lie within its skills and assets to transform its own  identity .  rob jameson , erisk"

4006,"Subject: re : the consultant ' s model for gary hickerson ' s group  the model is supposed to be a real option model to capture the value of  power plants of gencos . it is to give trader a better insight as to whether  the  market is overvaluing / undervaluing certain genco stocks , and trader can  act accordingly . i ' m still trying to find out how trader is supposed to use  it .  modeling details :  the model takes in all gencos ' locational power forward prices and fuel  forward  prices , and uses garch model to simulate one year daily prices , and then  uses a hourly profile to convert them into hourly prices . garch model  parameters  are estimated by the consultant using and separate model and  are updated twice a year , and it does not matter whether the simulation starts  in january or september .  using these prices , it will determine whether a unit at a particular location  will be dispatched  or not depending on a ) spread of power and fuel prices , and b ) whether the  start - up  cost can be recovered during 8 operation hours . the unit can be dispatched at  minimum and peak levels . fixed o & m , sox and nox ( i don ' t know what the last  two stand for )  are taken into consideration .  with the simulated dispatch schedule , the model calculates the value that can  be generated  by this unit , then sums it up across all units .  the final value is the average of 100 simulations . and it takes about 16  hours to run for about  200 units .  after our conversation , the consultant promised to look into a ) how to make  the model more flexible ,  say , to allow a different time horizon , b ) reduce spreadsheet overhead by  doing calculation one  unit a time and not saving all the intermediate information ( as of now it  saves everything  on the spreadsheet ) .  assuming the garch process is modelled correctly , i believe the methodology  is ok , though  it does not capture most of the optionality .  my concerns are :  whether the price processes are modelled correctly . i have to get more  details before making  any conclusion .  100 simulations are way too few . unless we convert the algorithm to c , i  don ' t see how spreadsheet  can handle more simulations . i guess that ' s why they contact us . but again ,  if enron ' s buying the  model from the consulting company , why should enron do their job for them ?  how trader ' s going to use the model output . for this i phoned jeff ( the  associate who initiated all  these ) and am still waiting for his returning call . a related questions why  the model horizon is one year .  we can either  oversee the conversation , but not doing actual coding for them .  or  redo the model for them . ( the problem still remains that how trader ' s going  to use the output ) . but  in view of the great wall of china separating the business units , should we  do it ?  as of now i have a simulation model taking start - up cost , fixed o & m , rump - up  delay into consideration .  it simulates monthly prices ( using gbm ) and takes 2 minutes 40 seconds to run  10 , 000 simulations for  one unit for ten years ( 120 time steps ) . it can use forward - forward vol and  incorporate seasonality into  it ( i understand this is debatable ) . ( one interesting observation is that  when using forward - forward vol  simulation , the standard deviation is about 0 . 5 % , while standard deviation  using forward vol is about  2 % . also , incorporating seasonality increases the value by about 1 . 6 % ) . since  most of the time - cost  occurs in price simulation , and we are to simulate about 20 price processes ,  i hope the full model  ( if we build it ) will take a couple of hours to run for 200 units . the main  task will be interfacing , i . e . ,  getting data from data base , and outputting the results . this is where i need  most help if i am to do it .  please advice the course of action . i am supposed to talk to michelle  cisneros today .  p . s . i never promised to oversee a programmer in our group ( see the message  below ) .  best ,  alex  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by alex huang / corp / enron on 01 / 05 / 2001 08 : 58  am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  jeff m gray  01 / 04 / 2001  to : gary . hickerson @ enron . com , michael . w . bradley @ enron . com ,  michelle . d . cisneros @ enron . com , jaime . gualy @ enron . com  cc : alex . huang @ enron . com , kskinner @ ftenergy . com , cseiple @ ftenergy . com  subject : fw : project timeline  ken and i worked up the following timeline and refined the trading  methodology a bit this morning . we also met with alex huang from vince ' s  group , and explained the model and coding tasks . ken and alex have arranged  to speak by phone on monday , and meanwhile alex is coordinating within the  research group . alex will oversee a programmer within his group , while  interfacing regularly with us .  1 / 4 kickoff  1 / 11 complete spreadsheet , table , and database structures ( rdi ) .  1 / 17 complete software coding for the pricemaker component of the model  ( rdi and enron research ) , and begin testing ( enron research ) .  1 / 22 complete software coding for the dispatch portion of the model ( rdi  and enron research ) , and begin testing ( enron research ) .  1 / 22 complete financial trader "" user "" interface , within the access  environment ( rdi ) .  1 / 22 complete collection and delivery of unverified generating - unit data from  rdi databases ( rdi ) . begin verification process ( rdi ) .  1 / 29 complete all charts and reports accessible from the user interface  ( rdi ) .  1 / 29 complete compilation of consensus ebitda forecasts for all operations  other than merchant generation ( enron financial trading ) .  2 / 9 complete code testing ( enron research ) .  2 / 9 deliver verified and quality - checked generating - unit data ( rdi ) .  2 / 9 complete the model , begin testing the trading methodology , and train  users .  2 / 16 finish training , testing , and final qc .  jeff"

3850,"Subject: var for metals  it is my preference to have an aggregated var methodology for the metals  business as soon as possible ( version la ) . i do not want to poison progress  with my opiniion , but i think that the critical first step is to find a way  to aggregate positions in coarse buckets , perhaps sacrificing precision for  speed , based on "" rules "" that oerations can deliver , research can stand behind  and commercial will accept . , and using an equally coarse var calculation  ( the equivalent of ad - hoc var ? ) that can be delivered to the "" official books  and records "" on a daily basis . this i believe would be acceptable for a 2 - 3  month time frame ( at which time we get versionlb ) as opposed to waiting 2 - 3  months to implement a better process and have nothing in the interim .  ultimately , i would look for version 2 a to be delivered and very defendable  by 1 / 1 / 01 . this will require indulgence and compromise on all fronts but i  cannot conceive of a better way . please let me know if this is consistent  with your understanding . a critical point from my perspective is that the mg  commercial team and metal operations staff understand their role in making  this happen and willingness to accept the consequences . i look for you to  take the lead as leader of the integration to do so . if you need any input  from the rest of us to underscore the importance please let us know . as i  alluded to on the phone , the people in houston that have been involved in the  var process have been through an extraordinary period of detailed scrutiny of  var by commercial and have been hindered by the lack of basic understanding  by all parties as their responsibilities . given the distance and the newness  of the metals personell , i fear that this could set us all up for some  surprises and some very uncomfortable communication , much of which is not  entirely necessary .  thanks  ted  eric gadd  07 / 21 / 2000 11 : 46 am  to : ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect , bjorn hagelmann / hou / ect @ ect  cc : richard sage / lon / ect @ ect  subject : attached fax  ted and bjorn -  we plan to release draft recommendations on metal position limits by close of  business on 24 july and have asked vince to prepare a v @ r computational  methodology prior to the 7 / 8 aug bod meeting ."
5896,"Subject: capital book  to further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing enron america ' s velocity of capital and associated return on invested capital , we have decided to create a capital book . the capital book will have no profit target associated with it and will be managed by joe deffner . the purpose of creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within enron americas , with any form of capital requirement , are structured correctly and are allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge .  the previous numbers used in the business plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets . therefore , on any assets currently held within each business area , the capital charge will remain at 15 % . internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating business unit subject to the internal ownership policy outlined below .  the cost of capital associated with all transactions in enron americas will be set by joe . this process is separate and apart from the current rac process for transactions which will continue unchanged .  capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15 % . transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15 % across the board charge . transactions which are structured off balance sheet , but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on enron america ' s overall credit capacity .  on transactions that deploy capital through the trading books , the capital book will take a finance reserve on each transaction , similar to the way the credit group takes a credit reserve . this finance reserve will be used specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction . as noted above , the capital book will have no budget and will essentially charge out to the origination and trading groups at actual cost .  by sending market - based capital pricing signals internally , enron america ' s sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the organization .  questions regarding the capital book can be addressed to :  joe deffner 853 - 7117  alan quaintance 345 - 7731"

"" for the insurance buyer , such exchange  instruments would not represent the perfect risk transfer vehicle , but  as long as they are quantifiable and indexable , they may represent a  good surrogate , "" he said .  the exchanges could also be used to create a derivatives market for  over - the - counter securitized deals , if there are regular issuers of  catastrophe bonds , mr . lane said .  the soft insurance market has also hindered the growth of  exchange - based insurance products , said sean f . mooney , senior  vp and chief economist at guy carpenter & co . , the reinsurance  brokerage unit of marsh inc . in new york .  "" the traditional market has been so competitive that people are not  looking for other ways of doing business , "" he said .  at least in concept , the exchange - based deals are generally similar  to the mortgage - backed securities that have been a huge success  since they were introduced in the 1970 s . "" there is a belief that  alternative means of transferring risks will grow , but it is difficult to  predict when , "" mr . mooney said .  currently , the trading that is taking place typically involves  established insurers and reinsurers , so the exchanges have not  brought substantial new capacity to the marketplace , he said .  guy carpenter provided the index for the bermuda commodities  exchange reinsurance products . the bce did not take off ,  however , and was suspended last year after two years of little  activity .  the oldest of the insurance - related , exchange - based derivative  products are the catastrophe options traded on the chicago board  of trade , which began trading the options in 1996 .  initially , there was substantial interest in the options , but the soft  traditional market has hampered use of the contracts to hedge  catastrophe exposures , said carlton purty , an independent broker  at the cbot who trades in options .  no catastrophe option trades have been completed at the cbot  so far this year , he said . last year , there was increased interest in  the contracts because of hurricane floyd , but few contracts were  traded , mr . purty said .  "" i think a major , major catastrophe will have to happen before they  really take off , "" he said .  the contracts offer real protection , and options dealers are keen to  trade in a new niche , but the conventional insurance and reinsurance  markets are so soft that few companies are turning to alternative  coverage options , mr . purty said .  the catastrophe risk exchange , located in princeton , n . j . , has  radically changed its structure since it was originally announced in  mid - 1996 , and it is well positioned to expand , said frank sweeney ,  chief operating officer .  catex initially planned to be a computer - based facility for  reinsurers that would enable them to exchange catastrophe risks  and to build balanced portfolios .  but by the time the exchange was operational in november 1996 , it  was clear that most reinsurers and insurers interested in catex  wanted only to buy and sell conventional reinsurance , mr . sweeney  said .  although there was some interest in risk swapping , only a handful of  risks were posted on the system , and none was traded , mr .  sweeney said .  consequently , catex has become chiefly a "" cash for cover ""  exchange , he said , noting that the risks reinsured on the exchange  include property catastrophe coverage , aviation and liability  coverages . catex also trades industry loss warranties , where  coverage is triggered by an actual loss combined with an industry  loss over an agreed threshold .  other adjustments to the exchange included making it accessible  through the internet in november 1998 . and late last year , catex  offered users the ability to set up smaller networks , allowing them  form groups whose members do business only with one another .  since its inception , catex has completed about 450 trades ,  totaling $ 400 million in premium and more than $ 3 billion in limits ,  he said . catex ' s roughly 160 subscribers include reinsurers ,  insurers and corporate entities that purchase coverage through their  captives , mr . sweeney said .  "" we obviously have a long way to go , but we are pretty satisfied  with what we have achieved so far , "" mr . sweeney said .  the exchange sees increased activity after major losses , as cedents  seek to buy replacement coverage to offset depletions in their  existing cover , he said . for example , mr . sweeney said , there was  a flurry of activity after the european windstorms in december last  year .  last september , the chicago mercantile exchange entered the field  of insurance - related derivatives when it began offering weather  derivatives .  thus far , 420 futures contracts have been traded , said larry  grannan , senior director in product marketing at the cme .  such contracts are designed to allow businesses to hedge against  weather - related losses . for example , a utility may sell less power in  a mild winter , and it would be able to use the futures to hedge a  resultant fall in revenues .  the exchange first offered heat - based indexes for atlanta , chicago ,  cincinnati and new york . in january , it added philadelphia , dallas ,  des moines , las vegas , tucson and portland , and it began offering  contracts based on cold weather .  currently , most of the trades are between securities dealers  themselves , but , eventually , the contracts will likely be used more  extensively by utilities and insurers , mr . grannan said .  in addition , the futures contracts could be used as hedges for  over - the - counter securitized deals , he said .  copyright , 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved ."

4379,"Subject: california update 1 / 31 / 01  please do not hesitate to contact robert johnston ( x 39934 ) or kristin walsh  ( x 39510 ) with additional questions .  executive summary  an announcement could be made as early as today regarding the first wave of  long - term contracts ( price and term ) .  the threat of bankruptcy is significantly diminishing as davis hatches a plan  to 1 ) pass on "" court ordered rate increases "" and 2 ) issue revenue bonds .  audit results are in and questions loom about the amount of funds transferred  to parent companies . davis is expected to use the threat of "" endless  appeals "" in courts and a possible ballot initiative in november to keep the  pressure on the parent companies to pay a share of the utility debt , as well  as to limit the scope of the rate hikes .  davis hopes that a court ruling in favor of the utilities would provide him  with the political cover he needs to pass on rate hikes to california  consumers and avoid utility bankruptcy .  davis walking a fine line with consumer advocacy groups . if there is a  ballot initiative in november to challenge the expected court - ordered rate  hikes , it could be disastrous for investor confidence in the state .  legislation and bail out  bill ablx was heard for several hours in the senate appropriations  yesterday . issues still remain regarding the tiered rate structure ,  specifically for communities that have harsh climates . however , the bill has  received support from almost everyone including consumer groups . the bill  is expected to pass sometime today . tim gage , ca director of finance said  davis supports all the provisions in ablx and expected to sign .  bill abl 8 x was not heard in the assembly yesterday but is expected to be hear  today . in committee hearings monday , the dwr testified it is spent all of  the $ 400 m and were spending $ 45 m / day in the spot market to buy power .  according to sources with direct access to governor davis , the on - going court  battle , as discussed below , is viewed as an excellent opportunity for a  settlement . davis recognizes that 1 ) the expected court ruling in the cpuc  case will likely authorize the utilities to increase rates charged to  california rate payers ; 2 ) despite that ruling , the state government has the  ability to delay the eventual reward of that order long enough to cripple the  two utilities unless they come to terms . thus , davis believes that  california consumers cannot avoid getting hit with higher electricity  charges , but he plans to use the threat of an appeal ( and a possible ballot  initiative ) to limit the amount of the rate hikes .  a plan to exempt the lowest income , smallest consumers from any rate increase  and to concentrate rate increases among consumers using 130 % of a baseline  usage rate was gaining serious momentum last night in sacramento . that would  still hit about one half of all consumers ( since the "" baseline "" is set at 60 %  of average consumption ) , but it is "" progressive "" in a politically important  sense .  making this work would require solving a minor crisis that erupted last night  when pg & e admitted they had stopped reading electricity meters for many  customers and were estimating their bills based on previous usage rates .  the company ' s defense ( they had laid off meter readers to conserve cash ) was  met with widespread derision as consumer advocates pointed out the estimation  policy conveniently allowed the company to charge more despite serious  efforts by californians to use less electricity . "" every time you think  there ' s a moment when these utilities will not embarrass themselves ,  something like this happens , "" one legislator moaned .  long - term contracts  a second key to keeping the eventual rate increases down lies in the  negotiations now almost complete for the first wave of long - term power buying  contracts davis initiated earlier this month . the first wave of those  contracts will be announced perhaps as early as today and they will be  surprisingly positive , according to officials in the talks . "" we got a series  of good offers in those initial proposals . and some not so good ones , "" one  official told our source . "" the idea is to announce the results of the first  contract talks with the good guys and then go back to the others and say ,  ' you want in on this with these terms ? ' we think we ' ll eventually shake  loose a lot of supply with this strategy . ""  bankruptcy  because of these new dynamics , there is improved market confidence that  california will emerge from the current energy crisis without bankruptcy for  socal edison and pg & e , even as they are set to miss another round of payments  to creditors and suppliers today ( remember , there is a standstill agreement  among creditors not to ask for accelerated payment until feb . 13 ) .  we believe that sense of optimism will be given an even more credible boost  by the court case in front of us district judge ronald s . w . lew in los  angeles , which is likely to mushroom into the kind of political cover for  elected officials that make a settlement possible by the end of next week , at  the latest . in fact , without that political cover it would be impossible to  square all the various circles of this crisis .  audit results and ballot initiatives  markets , bush administration officials , and perhaps utility companies  themselves are underweighting the possibility that citizens groups will  launch a successful ballot initiative in the fall of 200 l to bring all  electricity generation back under state control . the threat of a proposition  initiative mounted as the two audits of the utility companies ordered by the  california public utilities commission released in the last 48 hours  confirmed two seriously damaging points we have been warning about since  mid - january . first , the audit of socal edison confirmed that $ 2 billion of  the debt the utility claims it owes to energy suppliers is actually owed to  itself through its corporate holding structure that generates and sells  power . second , it confirmed that edison electric paid nearly $ 5 billion in  profits to the holding company which then used that money to buy back its  stock and increase dividends in an effort to keep its stock price up even  while it was going on a debt - issuing binge .  the audit of pg & e released late last night was even more damaging : pg & e  management was sharply criticized for poor decisions in failing to react to  "" clear warning signs of an approaching energy crisis "" by not making deep  spending cuts , "" including scaling back management salaries . "" the auditors  also questioned the utility ' s decision to funnel some $ 4 . 7 billion of its  profits since deregulation into the coffers of its parent holding company ,  which then used the cash mostly to pay dividends and buy back stocks .  "" basically , they took the money and ran , "" as state senate speaker burton put  it yesterday .  what appears to be governor gray davis ' grudging acceptance of reality is  actually a highly evolved effort to produce a solution that provides enough  rate hikes / taxpayer subsidy to help solve the current crisis without  triggering a new - - and far more damaging - - burst of populist outrage among  a voter base that still thinks the utility companies are basically making  this all up . there is no doubt that this use of money by socal edison and  the debts it owes to itself are perfectly legal and in keeping with the  spirit of the 1996 deregulation law , but that is irrelevant in popular  political terms . were it not for the political cover potentially afforded by  the court case discussed below , these audits would make settlement extremely  difficult .  keeping that anger from exploding into a ballot initiative this fall is key  to understanding the very complex game that davis , his advisers and senior  legislators are now playing . a ballot initiative would be a potential  disaster since it would almost certainly be aimed at re - establishing full  public control over the electric utilities . even if the state and utilities  successfully challenged such an initiative in court it would be years before  that victory was clear and it would freeze all new private investment during  that prolonged period . that ' s something california cannot afford as  businesses would be moving out and new ones failing to relocate .  court battle  thus , legislators are listening in horror as they hear the ugly details of  the court case in los angeles that socal edison and pg & e are likely to win in  mid - february . the court will most likely grant the two utilities $ 12 . 7  billion in relief and that the cost would fall immediately on the shoulders  of consumers who would see bills rise by at least 30 % , california politicians  could see the emergence of the one thing everyone has needed since the start  of this extended drama : political cover . davis will then have to rely on his  political and negotiating skills to pressure the parent companies of the  utilities to pass on something less than the full $ 12 . 7 billion debt .  pg & e and socal edison have already won round one of a legal battle designed  to let them raise electricity rates enough to recover all of the debt they  have accumulated since august last year when the puc refused to let them  raise prices even as electricity prices soared . the court said the 1996  deregulation law was crystal clear - - when the two utilities had repaid  so - called "" stranded costs , "" they were free to begin charging whatever they  needed to charge consumers to cover their cost of acquiring power .  although the utilities won this case , the judge stayed his order until  february 14 th at the state government ' s request . as that deadline  approaches , an intense new negotiating round is under way . on the one hand ,  political officials know they have the ultimate political cover for higher  electric prices ( "" the courts made me do it "" ) , but on the other hand , they  also know that immediate and full compliance with that court order would  force electricity rates up by about 40 % on top of natural gas bills that have  soared by about 300 % since last year . utility companies are playing this  card aggressively in negotiations about the scope and shape of the final  bailout . "" we ' ll just wait until the court puts the order into effect in  mid - february then even if we are in bankruptcy we will emerge quickly and  easily . ""  one tactic the state political officials are using , in order to force a  settlement , is the threat of keeping the law suit tied up in court for the  next couple of years . one political official pointed out that they could  keep the utilities from receiving their money this year , next year or perhaps  even the year after . "" sure , we tell them , they will probably win in court and  get that money . eventually . we are making them well aware that unless we  have a settlement we will appeal that court ruling all the way to the supreme  court and keep them tied up for the next two years at least . we don ' t think  the creditors will be quite that patient .
